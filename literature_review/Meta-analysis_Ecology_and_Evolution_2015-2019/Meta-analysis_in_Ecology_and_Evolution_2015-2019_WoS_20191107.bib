Abstract = {{Despite increasing frequency of invasions by alien plant species with
   widespread ecological and economic consequences, it remains unclear how
   belowground compartments of ecosystems are impacted. In order to
   synthetize current knowledge and provide future directions for research
   we performed a meta-analysis assessing the impact of invasive alien
   plant species on soil fauna abundance. Compared to previous synthesis on
   this topic, we included together in our model the trophic group of each
   soil faunal taxa (from herbivores to predators) and habitat structure,
   namely open and closed habitats (i.e. grass and shrub dominated areas
   versus forested areas). In doing so, we highlighted that both moderators
   strongly interact to determine the response of soil fauna to the
   presence of invasive alien plants. Soil fauna abundance increase in the
   presence of invasive species only in closed habitats (+18.2\%). This
   pattern of habitat-dependent response (positive effect in closed
   habitats) was only found for primary consumers (i.e. herbivores +29.1\%
   and detritivores +66.7\%) within both detritus-based and live root-based
   trophic pathways. Abundances of predators and microbivores did not
   respond to the presence of IAS irrespective of habitat structure. For
   several groups, the habitat structure (open or closed) significantly
   drove their responses to the presence of invasive alien species. In
   addition, we carefully considered potential sources of bias (e.g.
   geographic, taxonomic and functional) within the collected data in an
   attempt to highlight gaps in available knowledge on the subject. Our
   findings support the conclusions of previous studies on the subject by
   demonstrating 1) that soil fauna abundance is impacted by biological
   invasions, 2) that initial habitat structure has a strong influence on
   the outcome and 3) that responses within the soil fauna differ between
   trophic levels with a stronger response of primary consumers.}},

Title = {{Global meta-analysis reveals that invertebrate diversity is higher in
   permanent than in temporary lentic water bodies}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{One of the main constraints affecting invertebrate diversity in many
   freshwater lentic habitats is the presence of a dry phase which forces
   aquatic organisms to avoid this period through the migration to other
   water bodies or the production of resting stages. Field studies show
   contradictory results when comparing invertebrate diversity in permanent
   (PW) and temporary lentic waters (TW). Our objective was to test how
   diversity is influenced by the permanence of water in lentic habitats,
   and which factors affect the magnitude and direction of this difference,
   including sampling design. Through a systematic review, 66 publications
   were selected and classified according to the sampling design (spatial,
   temporal, and spatio-temporal datasets). Meta-analysis of the spatial
   dataset, which included 70\% of the studies, revealed that diversity in
   PW was higher than in TW, and this difference was not influenced by
   annual precipitation, dispersal mode, habitat type or level of
   anthropogenic impact (proximity to urban or agricultural areas). We
   found a significantly higher effect size (PW greater than TW) when
   considering species richness rather than cumulative richness or Shannon
   diversity index, disconnected water bodies (hindering the exchange of
   individuals through water connection), organisms with passive dispersal
   (which cannot actively avoid the dry period), and study sites with high
   anthropogenic impact (where temporary habitats could undergo impacts;
   e.g. concentration of pollutants and eutrophication). We also found that
   the differences in diversity between PW and TW may decrease with
   increasing sampling effort. This result may be attributable to high
   species turnover due to the higher temporal environmental variation in
   TW relative to PW. Also, it indicates that sampling effort should be
   comparatively higher in TW to properly characterize the biodiversity in
   these environments in order to compare with PW. As global climate
   continues to change, our results suggest that loss in aquatic
   invertebrate diversity of TW will be likely to occur in regions where
   the frequency of drying events increases.}},

Abstract = {{A large number of qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses have been
   performed to summarize the effects of river restoration, while
   systematic and quantitative assessments of the literature on river
   restoration are still rare. To fill this gap, we conducted a
   meta-analysis of 55 peer-reviewed publications describing assessments of
   river restoration with indicators of biodiversity or ecosystem services
   (ES). The core of the study was to identify: (i) the overall ecological
   effects of river restoration; (ii) the restoration effects on different
   organism groups and types of ES, including the relationship between
   biodiversity and ES; and (iii) the influence of the restoration context,
   that is degradation types, restoration techniques and restoration age.
   The meta-analysis revealed that river restoration significantly enhanced
   ecological conditions. However, restoration effects varied among
   organism groups and ES, with plant abundance and regulating services
   showing higher responses to restoration. Moreover, a trend of a positive
   correlation was found between biodiversity and ES. Restoration
   activities showed most significant effects in the context of
   hydromorphological degradation or land-use changes, and channel
   reconfiguration and riparian buffer establishment had a particularly
   favourable outcomes. Only regulating services showed a positive
   correlation with restoration age; thus, long-time monitoring is
   necessary to fully understand restoration effects. Overall, our
   meta-analysis provides evidence-based advice for future projects and
   assessment of river restoration.}},

Abstract = {{There is evidence that human activities are reducing the population

   total of 67 effect sizes. We found that parasite functional group
   (micro- or macroparasite) affects the presence of the effect and study

   magnitude. Our study also suggests that host genetic diversity is
   overall a robust defence against infection regardless of host
   reproduction, parasite host range, parasite diversity, virulence and the
   method by which parasite success was recorded. Combined, these results
   highlight the importance of monitoring declines of host population

Abstract = {{Understanding the importance of biotic interactions in driving the
   distribution and abundance of species is a central goal of plant
   ecology. Early vascular plants likely colonized land occupied by
   biocrusts - photoautotrophic, surface-dwelling soil communities
   comprised of cyanobacteria, bryophytes, lichens and fungi - suggesting
   biotic interactions between biocrusts and plants have been at play for
   some 2,000 million years. Today, biocrusts coexist with plants in
   dryland ecosystems worldwide, and have been shown to both facilitate or
   inhibit plant species performance depending on ecological context. Yet,
   the factors that drive the direction and magnitude of these effects
   remain largely unknown. We conducted a meta-analysis of plant responses
   to biocrusts using a global dataset encompassing 1,004 studies from six
   continents. Meta-analysis revealed there is no simple positive or
   negative effect of biocrusts on plants. Rather, plant responses differ
   by biocrust composition and plant species traits and vary across plant
   ontogeny. Moss-dominated biocrusts facilitated, while lichen-dominated
   biocrusts inhibited overall plant performance. Plant responses also
   varied among plant functional groups: C-4 grasses received greater
   benefits from biocrusts compared to C-3 grasses, and plants without
   N-fixing symbionts responded more positively to biocrusts than plants
   with N-fixing symbionts. Biocrusts decreased germination but facilitated
   growth of non-native plant species. Synthesis. Results suggest that
   interspecific variation in plant responses to biocrusts, contingent on
   biocrust type, plant traits, and ontogeny can have strong impacts on
   plant species performance. These findings have important implications
   for understanding biocrust contributions to plant productivity and
   community assembly processes in ecosystems worldwide.}},

Title = {{Ecological, biophysical and production effects of incorporating rest
   into grazing regimes: A global meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Grazing can have considerable ecological impacts when managed
   inappropriately, however livestock production is a significant
   contributor to global food security and the removal of land from
   production is not always a viable option. Grazing management practices
   that incorporate periods of planned rest (i.e. strategic-rest grazing)
   may be an alternative to grazing exclusion or continuous grazing that
   could achieve ecological and animal production outcomes simultaneously.
   We conducted a meta-analysis of global literature to investigate how
   strategic-rest grazing mediates ecological (i.e., plant richness and
   diversity), biophysical (plant biomass and ground cover) and production
   response variables (animal weight gain and animal production per
   hectare) compared to continuously grazed or ungrazed areas. Overall,
   total ground cover and animal production per hectare were significantly
   greater under strategic-rest grazing than continuous grazing management,
   but biomass, plant richness, plant diversity and animal weight gain did
   not differ between grazing treatments. Increasing the length of rest
   relative to graze time under strategic-rest grazing was associated with
   an increase in plant biomass, ground cover, animal weight gain and
   animal production per hectare when compared to continuous grazing.
   Synthesis and applications. Understanding both the ecological and animal
   production trade-offs associated with different grazing management
   strategies is essential to make informed decisions about best-management
   practices for the world's grazing lands. We show that incorporating
   periods of rest into grazing regimes improves ground cover and animal
   production per hectare and that these benefits are more pronounced with
   increases in the length of time land is rested for. This extended rest
   also improves biomass production and weight gain compared to continuous
   grazing systems. Based on these meta-analyses, we recommend that future
   research considers the duration of rest compared to graze time in
   comparisons of grazing systems.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use change is a prominent feature of the Anthropocene. Transitions
   between natural and human-managed ecosystems affect biogeochemical
   cycles in many ways, but soil processes are among the least understood.
   We used a global meta-analysis (62 studies, 1670 paired comparisons) to
   examine effects of land conversion on soil-atmosphere fluxes of methane
   (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from upland soils, and determine soil and
   environmental factors driving these effects. Conversion from a natural
   ecosystem to any anthropogenic land use increased soil CH4 and N2O
   fluxes by 234 kg CO2-equivalents ha(-1) y(-1), on average. Reversion of
   managed ecosystems to that resembling natural ecosystems did not fully
   reverse those effects, even after 80 years. In general, neither the type
   of ecosystem converted, nor the type of subsequent anthropogenic land
   use, affected the magnitude of increase in soil emissions. Land-use
   changes in wetter ecosystems resulted in greater increases in CH4
   fluxes, but reduced N2O fluxes. An interacting suite of soil variables
   influenced CH4 and N2O fluxes, with availability of inorganic nitrogen
   (that is, extractable ammonium and nitrate), pH, total carbon, and
   microclimate being strong mediators of effects of land-use change. In
   addition, time after a change in land use emerged as a critical factor
   explaining the effects of land-use change-with increased emissions of
   both greenhouse gases diminishing rapidly after conversion. Further
   research is needed to elucidate complex biotic and abiotic mechanisms
   that drive land-use change effects on soil greenhouse gas emissions, but
   particularly during this initial disturbance when emissions are greatest
   relative to native vegetation. Efforts to mitigate emissions will be
   severely hampered by this gap in knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{Direct quantification of terrestrial biosphere responses to global
   change is crucial for projections of future climate change in Earth
   system models. Here, we synthesized ecosystem carbon-cycling data from
   1,119 experiments performed over the past four decades concerning
   changes in temperature, precipitation, CO2 and nitrogen across major
   terrestrial vegetation types of the world. Most experiments manipulated
   single rather than multiple global change drivers in temperate
   ecosystems of the USA, Europe and China. The magnitudes of warming and
   elevated CO2 treatments were consistent with the ranges of future
   projections, whereas those of precipitation changes and nitrogen inputs
   often exceeded the projected ranges. Increases in global change drivers
   consistently accelerated, but decreased precipitation slowed down
   carbon-cycle processes. Nonlinear (including synergistic and
   antagonistic) effects among global change drivers were rare. Belowground
   carbon allocation responded negatively to increased precipitation and
   nitrogen addition and positively to decreased precipitation and elevated
   CO2. The sensitivities of carbon variables to multiple global change
   drivers depended on the background climate and ecosystem condition,
   suggesting that Earth system models should be evaluated using
   site-specific conditions for best uses of this large dataset. Together,

Abstract = {{Phenology is one of the most sensitive processes of plant in response to

   nitrogen (N) deposition, which significant affects plant phenology.
   Although numerous individual studies have been conducted, it remains
   controversial how N addition affects phenological stages, and a
   comprehensive understanding of how plant phenology responds to external
   N inputs remains elusive. To reconcile the differences, we conducted a
   meta-analysis of 117 species to examine the responses of plant phenology
   to N addition in terrestrial ecosystems, and assessed variations in
   their responses in relation to ecosystem types, functional groups, and
   environmental conditions. Our results showed that plant phenology
   changed significantly after N addition, and phenology time delayed and
   phenology duration shortened significantly across all biomes except
   fruiting duration, but varied with biome types. The phenology change in
   cropland was more dramatical than in grassland after N addition, even in
   opposite directions. The response of phenological stages to N addition
   was consistent in two pollination types except the flowering time, the
   flowering time had no change in anemophilous but significantly delayed
   in entomophilous. In addition, the response of phenology to N addition
   was discrepancy among functional groups, the phenology time advanced and
   duration shortened in sedge, while phenology time delayed and duration
   shortened in other groups, and the phenology change in legume was larger
   than grass and forbs. We also found that environmental factors had
   little effects on the response of plant phenology to N addition, but
   significant correlation was found between the response ratios of
   different phenological stages. Our study suggested that phenology was
   sensitive to N deposition at many phenological stages, and changes in
   phenology may be smaller with community biodiversity increasing at

   Spiders suppressed agricultural pest insects in 79\% of cases. The mean

   (Hedge's d = 0.89; 95\% confidence interval (CI95 )= 0.66-1.12). Spider
   pest suppression efficacy slightly increased also with taxonomic

   effects of spiders seemed to escalate rather than attenuate down through
   the agricultural food-chains (regression slopes > 1). The biocontrol
   efficacy of spiders was highest in rice followed by grape, cabbage and
   wheat. The pest suppression efficacy of spiders and the positive effect
   of spiders on crop yield slightly increased towards the tropics and with
   mean annual temperature. Spiders suppressed the four pest groups with
   similar efficacy. Main conclusions The meta-analysis provides strong
   evidence that spiders are effective in natural pest control and improve
   crop performance. However, the efficacy of spiders differed among crops.
   Our study substantiates the few earlier findings that predation pressure
   and the intensity of trophic cascades in terrestrial ecosystems
   intensify towards the tropics.}},

Abstract = {{Biological nitrogen (N) fixation (BNF), an important source of N in
   terrestrial ecosystems, plays a critical role in terrestrial nutrient
   cycling and net primary productivity. Currently, large uncertainty
   exists regarding how nutrient availability regulates terrestrial BNF and
   the drivers responsible for this process. We conducted a global
   meta-analysis of terrestrial BNF in response to N, phosphorus (P), and
   micronutrient (Micro) addition across different biomes (i.e,
   tropical/subtropical forest, savanna, temperate forest, grassland,
   boreal forest, and tundra) and explored whether the BNF responses were
   affected by fertilization regimes (nutrient-addition rates, duration,
   and total load) and environmental factors (mean annual temperature
   {[}MAT], mean annual precipitation {[}MAP], and N deposition). The
   results showed that N addition inhibited terrestrial BNF (by 19.0\%
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 17.7\%-20.3\%); hereafter), Micro
   addition stimulated terrestrial BNF (30.4\% {[}25.7\%-35.3\%]), and P
   addition had an inconsistent effect on terrestrial BNF, i.e., inhibiting
   free-living N fixation (7.5\% {[}4.4\%-10.6\%]) and stimulating
   symbiotic N fixation (85.5\% {[}25.8\%-158.7\%]). Furthermore, the
   response ratios (i.e., effect sizes) of BNF to nutrient addition were
   smaller in low-latitude (<30 degrees) biomes (8.5\%-36.9\%) than in
   mid-/high-latitude (>= 30 degrees) biomes (32.9\%-61.3\%), and the
   sensitivity (defined as the absolute value of response ratios) of BNF to
   nutrients in mid-/high-latitude biomes decreased with decreasing
   latitude (p <= 0.009; linear/logarithmic regression models).
   Fertilization regimes did not affect this phenomenon (p > 0.05), but
   environmental factors did affect it (p < 0.001) because MAT, MAP, and N
   deposition accounted for 5\%-14\%, 10\%-32\%, and 7\%-18\% of the
   variance in the BNF response ratios in cold (MAT < 15 degrees C),
   low-rainfall (MAP < 2,500 mm), and low-N-deposition (<7 kg ha(-1)
   year(-1)) biomes, respectively. Overall, our meta-analysis depicts a
   global pattern of nutrient impacts on terrestrial BNF and indicates that
   certain types of global change (i.e., warming, elevated precipitation
   and N deposition) may reduce the sensitivity of BNF in response to
   nutrient enrichment in mid-/high-latitude biomes.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological Niche Models (ENMs) have different performances in predicting

   effects of climate change on the potential geographic distribution of
   1,205 bird species from the Neotropical region, modeled using eight ENMs
   and three Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCM). We
   considered the variability in ENMs performance to estimate a weighted
   mean difference between potential geographic distributions for baseline
   and future climates. On average, potential future ranges were projected
   to be from 25.7\% to 44.5\% smaller than current potential ranges across
   species. However, we found that 0.2\% to 18.3\% of the total variance in
   range shifts occurred ``within species{''} (i.e., owing to the use of
   different modeling techniques and climate models) and 81.7\% to 99.8\%
   remained between species (i.e., it could be explained by ecological
   correlates). Using meta-analytical techniques akin to regression, we
   also showed that potential range shifts are barely predicted by bird
   biological traits. We demonstrated that one can combine and reduce
   species-specific effects with high uncertainty in ENMs and also explore
   potential causes of climate change effect on species using
   meta-analytical tools. We also highlight that the search for powerful
   correlates of climate change-induced range shifts can be a promising

Abstract = {{The adaptive value of transgenerational effects (the ancestor

   received much attention in recent years, but the related empirical
   evidence remains equivocal. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis
   summarising 139 experimental studies in plants and animals with 1170
   effect sizes to investigate the generality of transgenerational effects
   across taxa, traits, and environmental contexts. It was found that
   transgenerational effects generally enhanced offspring performance in
   response to both stressful and benign conditions. The strongest effects
   are in annual plants and invertebrates, whereas vertebrates appear to
   benefit mostly under benign conditions, and perennial plants show hardly
   any transgenerational responses at all. These differences among
   taxonomic/life-history groups possibly reflect that vertebrates can
   avoid stressful conditions through their mobility, and longer-lived
   plants have alternative strategies. In addition to environmental
   contexts and taxonomic/life-history groups, transgenerational effects
   also varied among traits and developmental stages of ancestors and
   offspring, but the effects were similarly strong across three
   generations of offspring. By way of a more comprehensive data set and a
   different effect size, our results differ from those of a recent

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Abstract = {{Aim Sediment disturbances are important threats affecting marine
   biodiversity, but the variety of biological responses has not yet been
   synthesized. Here, we collate all available information to compare the
   extent of impacts across different taxonomic groups, habitat types and
   pathways of impact (light attenuation, suspended sediment and
   sedimentation). Location Global. Time period Data collected from 1979 to
   2017. Major taxa studied Corals, fishes, seagrasses, sponges,
   macroalgae, ascidians, bryozoans, crustaceans, echinoderms, molluscs and
   polychaetes. Methods We used meta-analyses to evaluate the effects of
   sediments across 842 observations found in 110 publications. We also
   evaluated some of the biological and methodological factors that could
   explain the variable effects observed in different studies. Results We
   found a significant negative effect of sediments on behavioural
   responses of species, reproduction and recruitment processes, the
   morphology of organisms, physiology, community abundance and diversity,
   and species interactions. In contrast, the overall effect on the
   abundance of individual species was statistically non-significant and
   there was a strong positive effect on abundance for sponge and
   polychaete species. Many individual studies described physiological
   effects on coral reefs, but the effects on the diversity of soft-bottom
   and coral reef communities were particularly detrimental. Phototrophic
   species were generally more negatively impacted by sediments than
   heterotrophs, driven by strong physiological responses in crustose
   coralline algae and seagrasses. Additionally, species with limited
   mobility were more vulnerable to sediment disturbances than highly
   mobile species. Sedimentation alone triggered more consistently negative
   effects on most biological responses than light depletion and suspended
   sediments. We found evidence for increased impacts on community
   diversity when more than one pathway of impact was present, indicating
   that these disturbances can disrupt whole ecosystems. Main conclusions
   Our meta-analysis provided, for the first time, strong quantitative
   support of negative effects of sediments on marine biodiversity.
   Taxonomic groups, habitat types and life-history characteristics were
   most influential in determining the biological responses to sediment
   disturbances, highlighting the importance of an ecosystem-based approach

Abstract = {{The development of buildings and other infrastructure in cities is
   viewed as a threat to local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning
   because natural habitat is replaced. However, there is momentum for
   implementing green infrastructure (GI), such as green roofs, wetland
   detention basins and community gardens, that partially offset these
   impacts and that benefit human health. GI is often designed to
   explicitly support ecosystem services, including implied benefits to
   biodiversity. The effects of GI on biodiversity have been rarely
   quantified, but research on this topic has increased exponentially in
   the last decade and a synthesis of the literature is needed. Here, we
   examined 1,883 published manuscripts and conducted a meta-analysis on 33
   studies that were relevant. We determined whether GI provides additional
   benefits to biodiversity over conventional infrastructure or natural
   counterparts. We also highlighted research gaps and identified
   opportunities to improve future applications. We determined that GI
   significantly improves biodiversity over conventional infrastructure
   equivalents, and that in some cases GI had comparable measures of
   biodiversity to natural counterparts. Many studies were omitted from
   these analyses because we found GI research has generally neglected
   conventional experimental design frameworks, including controls,
   replication or adequate sampling effort. Synthesis and applications. Our
   synthesis identified that taxa specificity is an important consideration
   for green infrastructure (GI) design relative to the more common
   measurements at the community level. We also identified that ignoring
   multi-trophic interactions and landscape-level patterns can limit our
   understanding of GI effects on biodiversity. We recommend further
   examination of species-specific differences among infrastructures (i.e.
   green, conventional or natural equivalents) or using functional traits
   to improve the efficacy of GI implementation on urban biodiversity.
   Furthermore, we encourage policy makers and practitioners to improve the
   design of GI to benefit urban ecosystems because of the potential
   benefits for both humans and global biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife translocations can have conservation value but results have

   Practitioners have adopted antipredator training, environmental
   enrichment, and soft release as pre-release conditioning tactics to
   encourage adaptive behavior and improve post-release survival, but their
   utility has not been broadly quantified. We performed a formal
   literature review and conducted meta-analysis on 108 effects from 41
   studies experimentally testing how these tactics affected survival,
   movement, or site fidelity compared to unconditioned animals. We further
   investigated how each conditioning tactic, animal source (wild-to-wild
   translocated or captive-released), age, and taxonomic group (birds,
   fish, mammals, and reptiles) influenced outcomes. Relative to
   unconditioned animals, conditioned individuals were 1.5 times more
   likely to survive, had reduced movement, and were three times more
   likely to show site fidelity. Each of the three conditioning tactics
   resulted in improved survival. Juveniles released from captivity derived
   the greatest survival benefit from conditioning. Across taxa,
   conditioning most benefitted survival of fish. Conditioning also had
   positive effects on survival of mammals and reptiles, albeit with less
   certainty than for fish. Estimates comparing survival of conditioned to
   unconditioned birds were much more variable, suggesting avian
   translocation programs using conditioning generally need improvement.
   Soft release consistently reduced movement and increased site fidelity;
   this was an especially viable technique for adult wild-to-wild
   translocated animals. We provide quantitative evidence that behavioral
   conditioning can aid wildlife translocations, and we encourage continued
   experiments to further elucidate how refined tactics could advance
   conservation efforts using translocation as a management tool.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of DNA forensics, research on seafood fraud has
   increased drastically. The documentation of mislabeling has raised
   concern over the identity, value, and safety of seafood. However, the
   general characterization of mislabeling is limited. We conduct a
   Bayesian meta-analysis to estimate global mislabeling rates and their
   uncertainty across several factors. While the effort to document
   mislabeling is impressive, it is highly skewed toward certain taxa and
   geographies. For most products, including all invertebrates, there is
   insufficient data to produce useful estimates. For others, the
   uncertainty of estimates has been underappreciated. Mislabeling is
   commonly characterized by study-level means. Doing so often
   overestimates mislabeling, masks important product information, and is
   of limited utility-particularly given that studies often lack adequate
   sampling designs for parameter estimation. At the global level, overall
   mislabeling rates do not differ statistically across supply chain
   locations, product forms, or countries. Product-level estimates are the
   most informative. The majority of products, for which there is
   sufficient data, have mislabeling estimates lower than commonly
   reported. The most credible average mislabeling rate at the
   product-level is 8\% (95\% HDI: 4-14\%). Importantly, some products have
   high estimates, which should be priorities for research and
   interventions. Estimates must be combined with other data in order to
   understand the extent and potential consequences of mislabeling, which
   is likely to vary drastically by product. Our meta-analysis, which can
   be updated with new data, provides a foundation for prioritizing
   research to inform programs and policies to reduce seafood fraud.}},

Abstract = {{Most theoretical works predict that selfing should reduce the level of
   additive genetic variance available for quantitative traits within
   natural populations. Despite a growing number of quantitative genetic
   studies undertaken during the last two decades, this prediction is still
   not well supported empirically. To resolve this issue and confirm or
   reject theoretical predictions, we reviewed quantitative trait
   heritability estimates from natural plant populations with different
   rates of self-fertilization and carried out a meta-analysis. In
   accordance with models of polygenic traits under stabilizing selection,
   we found that the fraction of additive genetic variance is negatively
   correlated with the selfing rate. Although the mating system explains a
   moderate fraction of the variance, the mean reduction of narrow-sense
   heritability values between strictly allogamous and predominantly
   selfing populations is strong, around 60\%. Because some nonadditive
   components of genetic variance become selectable under inbreeding, we
   determine whether self-fertilization affects the relative contribution
   of these components to genetic variance by comparing narrow-sense
   heritability estimates from outcrossing populations with broad-sense
   heritability estimated in autogamous populations. Results suggest that
   these nonadditive components of variance may restore some genetic
   variance in predominantly selfing populations; it remains, however,
   uncertain how these nonadditive components will contribute to

Abstract = {{Evolutionary approaches are gaining popularity in conservation science,
   with diverse strategies applied in efforts to support adaptive
   population outcomes. Yet conservation strategies differ in the type of
   adaptive outcomes they promote as conservation goals. For instance,
   strategies based on genetic or demographic rescue implicitly target
   adaptive population states whereas strategies utilizing
   transgenerational plasticity or evolutionary rescue implicitly target
   adaptive processes. These two goals are somewhat polar: adaptive state
   strategies optimize current population fitness, which should reduce
   phenotypic and/or genetic variance, reducing adaptability in changing or
   uncertain environments; adaptive process strategies increase genetic
   variance, causing maladaptation in the short term, but increase
   adaptability over the long term. Maladaptation refers to suboptimal
   population fitness, adaptation refers to optimal population fitness, and
   (mal)adaptation refers to the continuum of fitness variation from
   maladaptation to adaptation. Here, we present a conceptual
   classification for conservation that implicitly considers
   (mal)adaptation in the short-term and long-term outcomes of conservation
   strategies. We describe cases of how (mal)adaptation is implicated in
   traditional conservation strategies, as well as strategies that have
   potential as a conservation tool but are relatively underutilized. We
   use a meta-analysis of a small number of available studies to evaluate
   whether the different conservation strategies employed are better suited
   toward increasing population fitness across multiple generations. We
   found weakly increasing adaptation over time for transgenerational
   plasticity, genetic rescue, and evolutionary rescue. Demographic rescue
   was generally maladaptive, both immediately after conservation
   intervention and after several generations. Interspecific hybridization
   was adaptive only in the F-1 generation, but then rapidly leads to
   maladaptation. Management decisions that are made to support the process
   of adaptation must adequately account for (mal)adaptation as a potential
   outcome and even as a tool to bolster adaptive capacity to changing
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the increasing scholarly attention that Payments for Ecosystem
   Services (PES) are receiving, little is yet known about the process of

   Through a meta-analysis of payments for forest watershed services in

   for ecosystem services and that this difference is not due to
   transaction costs. Instead, it reveals a substantial subsidising

   make over for the subsidization of schemes and would require the
   implementation of specific mechanisms to adjust prices. According to our
   results, one of such possible mechanisms would be to increase

   we report on a vote-count meta-analysis of peer reviewed quantitative
   studies in the U.S. to examine an array of forest landowner behaviors.
   We extend other reviews of this literature by including papers with any
   behavioral dependent variable, rather than only timber harvesting or
   land management behavior. We document the significance, direction, and
   frequency of independent variables examined with regard to 13 categories
   of behavior including participation in policy tools, cross-boundary
   cooperation, invasive species management, and wildlife management.
   Study-level characteristics are reported for the 128 published studies
   that met initial inclusion criteria for this analysis (quantitative
   studies within the U.S. modeling landowner behavior that were published
   between 2002 and 2016). Thirty-eight studies that statistically modeled
   landowner behavior were further analyzed. Studies examining intentions
   were excluded, as were qualitative explorations of landowner behavior.
   The most commonly studied behavior included in our analysis was
   participation in landowner incentive programs, and the least common was
   participation in cross-boundary cooperation. Among independent
   variables, owner characteristics and ownership objectives were most
   commonly included. Independent variables found to be significant across
   behaviors examined included: current/past landowner behaviors,
   knowledge, and parcel size/forested acres. Actions like cross boundary
   cooperation and landowner interactions have not been quantitatively
   modeled as often as other actions, and represent key areas for future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Immunosenescence, the decline in immune defense with age, is an
   important mortality source in elderly humans but little is known of
   immunosenescence in wild animals. We systematically reviewed and
   meta-analysed evidence for age-related changes in immunity in captive
   and free-living populations of wild species (321 effect sizes in 62
   studies across 44 species of mammals, birds and reptiles). As in humans,
   senescence was more evident in adaptive (acquired) than innate immune
   functions. Declines were evident for cell function (antibody response),
   the relative abundance of naive immune cells and an in vivo measure of
   overall immune responsiveness (local response to phytohaemagglutinin
   injection). Inflammatory markers increased with age, similar to chronic
   inflammation associated with human immunosenescence. Comparisons across
   taxa and captive vs free-living animals were difficult due to lack of
   overlap in parameters and species measured. Most studies are
   cross-sectional, which yields biased estimates of age-effects when
   immune function co-varies with survival. We therefore suggest
   longitudinal sampling approaches, and highlight techniques from human
   cohort studies that can be incorporated into ecological research. We

Title = {{A review and meta-analysis of intraspecific differences in phenotypic
   plasticity: Implications to forecast plant responses to climate change}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Abstract = {{Aim Many studies use differences among plant populations to infer future
   plant responses, but these predictions will provide meaningful insights
   only if patterns of plasticity among populations are similar (i.e., in
   the absence of population-by-environment interaction, P x E). In this
   study, we tested whether P x E is considered in climate change studies.
   Specifically, we evaluated whether population differentiation varies
   across environments and whether P x E is determined by aspects of the
   study system and experimental design. Location Global. Methods We
   conducted a literature search in the Thomson Reuters Web of Science
   database to identify studies assessing population differentiation in a
   climate change context. We quantified the occurrence of P x E and
   performed a meta-analysis to calculate the percentage of traits showing
   P x E in the study cases. Results We identified 309 study cases (from
   237 published articles) assessing population differentiation in 172
   plant species, of which 64\% included more than one test environment and
   tested P x E. In 77\% of these studies, P x E was significant for at
   least one functional trait. The overall proportion of traits showing P x
   E was 33.4\% (95\% confidence interval 27.7-39.3). These results were
   generally consistent across life-forms, ecoregions and type of
   experiment. Furthermore, population differentiation varied across test
   environments in 76\% of cases. The overall proportion of traits showing
   environment-dependent population differentiation was 53.7\% (95\%
   confidence interval 37.9-69.3). Conclusions Our findings revealed that
   differences in phenotypic plasticity among populations are common but
   are usually neglected in order to forecast population responses to
   climate change. Future studies should assess population differentiation
   in many test environments (accounting for P x E) that realistically
   reflect future environmental conditions, assessing climate change
   drivers that are rarely considered (e.g., multifactor experiments
   incorporating higher CO2 levels). Our review also revealed the
   predominant focus of population studies on trees from temperate
   climates, identifying underexplored life-forms (shrubs, annuals),
   phylogenetic groups (ferns, ancient gymnosperms) and ecoregions
   (tropical, arctic) that should receive more attention in future.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing {[}CO2] in the atmosphere increases crop productivity.
   However, grain quality of cereals and pulses are substantially decreased
   and consequently compromise human health. Meta-analysis techniques were
   employed to investigate the effect of elevated {[}CO2] (e{[}CO2]) on
   protein, zinc (Zn), and iron (Fe) concentrations of major food crops
   (542 experimental observations from 135 studies) including wheat, rice,
   soybean, field peas, and corn considering different levels of water and
   nitrogen (N). Each crop, except soybean, had decreased protein, Zn, and
   Fe concentrations when grown at e{[}CO2] concentration (>= 550 mu
   mol/mol) compared to ambient {[}CO2] (a{[}CO2]) concentration (<= 380 mu
   mol/mol). Grain protein, Zn, and Fe concentrations were reduced under
   e{[}CO2]; however, the responses of protein, Zn, and Fe concentrations
   to e{[}CO2] were modified by water stress and N. There was an increase
   in Fe concentration in soybean under medium N and wet conditions but
   nonsignificant. The reductions in protein concentrations for wheat and
   rice were similar to 5\%-10\%, and the reductions in Zn and Fe
   concentrations were similar to 3\%-12\%. For soybean, there was a small
   and nonsignificant increase of 0.37\% in its protein concentration under
   medium N and dry water, while Zn and Fe concentrations were reduced by
   similar to 2\%-5\%. The protein concentration of field peas decreased by
   1.7\%, and the reductions in Zn and Fe concentrations were similar to
   4\%-10\%. The reductions in protein, Zn, and Fe concentrations of corn
   were similar to 5\%-10\%. Bias in the dataset was assessed using a
   regression test and rank correlation. The analysis indicated that there
   are medium levels of bias within published meta-analysis studies of

Abstract = {{Reversing global declines in the abundance and diversity of fishes is
   dependent on science-based conservation solutions. A wealth of data
   exist on the ecophysiological constraints of many fishes, but much of
   this information is underutilized in recovery plans due to a lack of
   synthesis. Here, we used the imperiled green sturgeon (Acipenser
   medirostris) as an example of how a quantitative synthesis of
   physiological data can inform conservation plans, identify knowledge
   gaps and direct future research actions. We reviewed and extracted
   metadata from peer-reviewed papers on green sturgeon. A total of 105
   publications were identified, spanning multiple disciplines, with the
   primary focus being conservation physiology (23.8\%). A meta-analytical
   approach was chosen to summarize the mean effects of prominent stressors
   (elevated temperatures, salinity, low food availability and
   contaminants) on several physiological traits (growth, thermal
   tolerance, swimming performance and heat shock protein expression). All
   examined stressors significantly impaired green sturgeon growth, and
   additional stressor-specific costs were documented. These findings were
   then used to suggest several management actions, such as mitigating salt
   intrusion in nursery habitats and maintaining water temperatures within
   optimal ranges during peak spawning periods. Key data gaps were also
   identified; research efforts have been biased towards juvenile (38.1\%)
   and adult (35.2\%) life-history stages, and less data are available for
   early life-history stages (embryonic, 11.4\%; yolk-sac larvae, 12.4\%;
   and post yolk-sac larvae, 16.2\%). Similarly, most data were collected
   from single-stressor studies (91.4\%) and there is an urgent need to
   understand interactions among stressors as anthropogenic change is
   multi-variate and dynamic. Collectively, these findings provide an
   example of how meta-analytic reviews are a powerful tool to inform
   management actions, with the end goal of maximizing conservation gains

Abstract = {{The contribution of genetic variation to phenotypes is a central factor
   in whether and how populations respond to selection. The most common
   approach to estimating these influences is via the calculation of
   heritabilities, which summarize the contribution of genetic variation to
   phenotypic variation. Heritabilities also indicate the relative effect
   of genetic variation on phenotypes versus that of environmental sources
   of variation. For labile traits like behavioral responses, life history
   traits, and physiological responses, estimation of heritabilities is
   important as these traits are strongly influenced by the environment.
   Thus, knowing whether or not genetic variation is present within
   populations is necessary to understand whether or not these populations
   can evolve in response to selection. Here we report the results of a
   meta-analysis summarizing what we currently know about the heritability
   of behavior. Using phylogenetically controlled methods we assessed the
   average heritability of behavior (0.235)-which is similar to that
   reported in previous analyses of physiological and life history traits-
   and examined differences among taxa, behavioral classifications, and
   other biologically relevant factors. We found that there was
   considerable variation among behaviors as to how heritable they were,
   with migratory behaviors being the most heritable. Interestingly, we
   found no effect of phylogeny on estimates of heritability. These results
   suggest, first, that behavior may not be particularly unique in the
   degree to which it is influenced by factors other than genetics and,
   second, that those factors influencing whether a behavioral trait will
   have low or high heritability require further consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Ongoing global changes are causing major ecological shifts worldwide.
   Biological trends need to be assessed over long periods of time to
   better understand past and current community responses. The present
   study developed a methodological framework for meta-analyses to be
   conducted that account for the temporal and spatial autocorrelation of
   observational data. We provided the R code for processing this
   framework, which enables temporal trends to be tested through the
   analysis of long-term, spatially structured datasets. Taking both types
   of autocorrelation into account resulted in more conservative but
   arguably more reliable statistical outcomes. This meta-analysis
   framework was then applied to investigate long-term trends in
   environmental and fish-community time series in multiple stations in
   large French rivers over the past 4 decades. General significant upward
   and downward trends were highlighted in water temperature and flow
   discharge, respectively, over the study period. Concomitantly, the
   density of numerous species increased, resulting in large increases in
   both species richness (about + 50\%) and total fish abundance
   (approximately four-fold), but with no significant trend in species
   evenness. Strong changes in species composition were observed during the
   study period, with an overall upward trend in the relative abundance of
   newcomers (i.e. species not sampled during the first years of the
   survey), while the trend in relative abundance of non-native species was
   non-significant. Moreover, the strongest signal underlying community
   changes was replacement of northern by southern species. This study
   showed major changes in fish density and community structure in large
   rivers over the past 40years and represents, to our knowledge, one of
   the first large-scale actual demonstrations (i.e. based on observations
   rather than predictions) of an overall poleward shift of freshwater fish
   communities in response to ongoing global changes.}},

Abstract = {{Most current research on land-use intensification addresses its
   potential to either threaten biodiversity or to boost agricultural
   production. However, little is known about the simultaneous effects of
   intensification on biodiversity and yield. To determine the responses of
   species richness and yield to conventional intensification, we conducted
   a global meta-analysis synthesizing 115 studies which collected data for
   both variables at the same locations. We extracted 449 cases that cover
   a variety of areas used for agricultural (crops, fodder) and
   silvicultural (wood) production. We found that, across all production
   systems and species groups, conventional intensification is successful
   in increasing yield (grand mean + 20.3\%), but it also results in a loss
   of species richness (-8.9\%). However, analysis of sub-groups revealed
   inconsistent results. For example, small intensification steps within
   low intensity systems did not affect yield or species richness. Within
   high-intensity systems species losses were non-significant but yield
   gains were substantial (+15.2\%). Conventional intensification within
   medium intensity systems revealed the highest yield increase (+84.9\%)
   and showed the largest loss in species richness (-22.9\%). Production
   systems differed in their magnitude of richness response, with
   insignificant changes in silvicultural systems and substantial losses in
   crop systems (-21.2\%). In addition, this meta-analysis identifies a
   lack of studies that collect robust biodiversity (i.e. beyond species
   richness) and yield data at the same sites and that provide quantitative
   information on land-use intensity. Our findings suggest that, in many
   cases, conventional land-use intensification drives a trade-off between
   species richness and production. However, species richness losses were
   often not significantly different from zero, suggesting even
   conventional intensification can result in yield increases without
   coming at the expense of biodiversity loss. These results should guide
   future research to close existing research gaps and to understand the
   circumstances required to achieve such win-win or win-no-harm situations
   in conventional agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing recognition that pollination deficits are limiting
   crop yields world-wide. However, management strategies for optimal
   insect pollination are still unclear for most crops. Current management
   focuses on providing high densities of honeybees, but recommended
   densities are highly variable, even within single crops and cultivars.
   We performed an extensive literature search to record honeybee densities
   (colony density and/or flower visitation rates) and crop productivity
   (fruit set, seed set, fruit weight and/or yield). Effect sizes were
   represented as the difference in crop productivity between the two most
   extreme levels of honeybee densities. Out of 795 reviewed studies, only
   22 analysed the effect of at least two levels of honeybee densities on
   crop productivity (reporting 60 resulting effect sizes in total).
   Moreover, few recommendations for crop pollination management are based
   on results from controlled experimental designs, and with comparable
   methodology. We found that both colony density and visitation rates
   increased all the productivity variables. However, effects were
   nonlinear for visitation rates, suggesting that there is an optimum
   (mean of 8-10 visits per flower) beyond which more honeybees are not
   beneficial (and can even be detrimental) for crop productivity. Effect
   sizes for visitation rates were greater than that for colony densities,
   suggesting that visitation rates are a more direct measure of the
   pollination process. Data on the relation between colony density and
   visitation rates are lacking. Interestingly, effect sizes for visitation
   rates were greater for crops with separate sexes than those with
   hermaphroditic flowers; therefore, the benefits of honeybee pollination
   vary according to the crop biology.Synthesis and applications. Current
   practices for crop pollination assume that more honeybees are always
   better for crop yield, even if the effect of this management on crop
   production still unclear. In contrast, our analyses suggest that there
   is an optimum for honeybee densities. Despite the importance of
   honeybees and pollinator-dependent crops world-wide, there is a lack of
   studies designed for finding such an optimal level of crop pollination.
   Our analyses further suggest that visitation rates could be used as a
   proxy to guide management recommendations such as colony density and
   spatial arrangement.
   Foreign Language AbstractResumen
   Los deficits de polinizacion estan limitando la productividad de los
   cultivos en todo el mundo. Para sustentar el servicio de polinizacion en
   zonas de agricultura intensiva, el manejo actual consiste en saturar los
   cultivos de flores con abejas meliferas proveyendo altas densidades de
   colmenas. Sin embargo, se sabe muy poco sobre la eficiencia de este
   manejo para poder alcanzar una polinizacion optima y existe controversia
   respecto las densidades recomendadas. Realizamos una sintesis global de
   la literatura cientifica para registrar la densidad de abejas meliferas
   (tasa de visitas o densidad de colmenas) y la productividad de los
   cultivos (cantidad de frutos o de semillas por flor, peso del fruto, o
   rendimiento por hectarea o planta). Los tamanos de efecto se calcularon
   como la diferencia en la productividad entre los dos niveles mas
   extremos de densidades de abejas. De los 795 estudios revisados, solo 22
   analizaron el efecto de al menos dos niveles de densidad de abejas sobre
   la productividad de los cultivos (resultando en 60 tamanos de efecto en
   total). Ademas, pocos estudios se basan en los resultados de disenos
   experimentales controlados y con una metodologia comparable. Encontramos
   que tanto la tasa de visita como la densidad de colmenas aumentaron
   todas las variables de productividad. Sin embargo, el efecto de la tasa
   de visita fue curvilineo, lo que sugiere que hay un optimo (8-10 visitas
   por flor) mas alla del cual mas abejas no es beneficioso (o incluso
   perjudicial) para la productividad de los cultivos. Los tamanos de
   efecto para la tasa de visitas fueron mayores que para la densidad de
   colmenas, lo que sugiere que la tasa de visitas es una medida mas
   directa del proceso de polinizacion. Faltan datos sobre la relacion
   entre la tasa de visitas y la densidad de colmenas. De modo interesante,
   el tamano de efecto de la tasa de visitas fue mayor para cultivos con
   sexos separados que para aquellos con flores hermafroditas, lo que
   sugiere que los beneficios de la polinizacion por la abeja melifera
   dependen de la biologia floral. Sintesis y aplicaciones. El manejo
   actual para la polinizacion de los cultivos asume que mas abejas siempre
   aumenta la productividad de los cultivos. En cambio, nuestros analisis
   sugieren que existe un optimo para la tasa de visita de abejas y que esa
   variable podria usarse como un proxy para guiar las recomendaciones de
   manejo, como la densidad de colmenas y su disposicion espacial.

Abstract = {{Aim Organisms that disturb the soil while foraging or creating shelter
   (ecosystem engineers) can have profound effects on ecosystems. Soil
   ejecta from these disturbances can enhance surface nutrients and the
   resulting depressions accrue organic matter and develop into biological
   hotspots. Here, we describe a global meta-analysis of studies that
   assessed the impacts of vertebrate soil disturbance on both biotic and
   abiotic components of ecosystems. Location Global land surface. Time
   period 1941-2016. Major taxa studied Vertebrates. Methods After
   conducting a systematic literature search, we quantitatively synthesized
   the findings of 149 published studies that compared disturbed and
   undisturbed surfaces. Our meta-analysis included 64 engineer species,
   primarily comprised of rodents and a subset of other mammals. Results We
   found that vertebrate soil disturbance significantly enhanced soil
   nitrogen (by 77\%) and phosphorus (35\%), and the productivity (32\%)
   and recruitment (32\%) of vascular plants. Disturbances had a greater
   cover of bare soil (126\%) than undisturbed controls, and higher
   abundances of secondary vertebrates (1,233\%), that use pre-constructed
   burrows as shelter and foraging grounds. Soil disturbance significantly
   reduced water run-off (63\%) and the abundance of biocrusts (82\%). Soil
   disturbance effects generally intensified with increasing aridity, and
   the magnitude of soil disturbance effects was not moderated by the area
   of the disturbance. Disturbances older than 12 months were more distinct
   from the surrounding matrix than fresh disturbances. The phylogeny of
   engineers was unrelated to their ecosystem effects, indicating that the
   same functionality could readily evolve in different taxa. Main
   conclusions In general, disturbances become localized patches of
   elevated functioning, providing strong evidence that vertebrate
   engineers, especially those in drylands, are an important source of
   environmental heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Aim We sought to understand how the individual and combined effects of

   terrestrial nitrogen (N) concentrations and N pools and whether the
   interactive effects of these drivers are mainly antagonistic,

   Major taxa studied Plants, soil, and soil microbes in terrestrial
   ecosystems. Methods We synthesized data from manipulative field studies
   from 758 published articles to estimate the individual, combined and
   interactive effects of key environmental change drivers (elevated CO2,
   warming, N addition, phosphorus addition, increased rainfall and
   drought) on plant, soil, and soil microbe N concentrations and pools
   using meta-analyses. We assessed the influences of moderator variables
   on these effects through structural equation modelling. Results We found
   that (a) N concentrations and N pools were significantly affected by the
   individual and combined effects of multiple drivers, with N addition
   (either alone or in combination with another driver) showing the
   strongest positive effects; (b) the individual and combined effects of
   these drivers differed significantly between N concentrations and N
   pools in plants, but seldom in soils and microbes; (c) additive effects
   of driver pairs on N concentrations and pools were much more common than
   synergistic or antagonistic effects across plants, soils and microbes;
   and (d) environmental and experimental factors were important moderators
   of the individual, combined and interactive effects of these drivers on

   concentrations and N pools, especially those of plants, can be
   significantly affected by the individual and combined effects of

Abstract = {{Nest predation is the leading cause of nesting failure. Thus it is a
   crucial area of research needed to inform conservation management and to

   review the identity of nest predators and the factors affecting nest
   predation, in Australia using 177 studies. Overall, 94 nest predators
   were identified when incorporating artificial nests, 69 without. Using
   only natural nests, the Pied Currawong Strepera graculina was the most
   frequently reported nest predator. Five nest predators, including Pied
   Currawong, depredated 40\% of the prey measured by the number of prey
   species taken. Yet, 60\% of predation was carried out by the other 64
   species, which included by the order of importance birds, mammals,
   reptiles, frogs and ants. Predation at cup and dome nests was more
   frequently reported than at burrow, ground and hollow nests. Only 28\%
   of predators were observed at both artificial and natural nests
   suggesting artificial nests have limited, but not negligible, ability as
   tools for identifying predators. There was a highly significant and
   positive correlation between predator and prey masses. The predator prey
   mass ratio was calculated with a mean 0.25 and a median 0.22, a result

Abstract = {{When herbivorous insects interact, they can increase or decrease each

   hypotheses of herbivorous insect diversification predict that diet

   these predictions using phylogenetic meta-analysis. We estimate the
   effects of diet breadth, population density and proxies of niche
   overlap: phylogenetic relatedness, physical proximity and feeding-guild
   membership. As predicted, we find that competition between herbivorous
   insects increases with population density as well as phylogenetic and
   physical proximity. Contrary to predictions, competition tends to be
   stronger between than within feeding guilds and affects specialists as
   much as generalists. This is the first statistical evidence that niche
   overlap increases competition between herbivorous insects. However,

Abstract = {{Climate warming will affect terrestrial ecosystems in many ways, and
   warming-induced changes in terrestrial carbon (C) cycling could
   accelerate or slow future warming. So far, warming experiments have
   shown a wide range of C flux responses, across and within biome types.
   However, past meta-analyses of C flux responses have lacked sufficient
   sample size to discern relative responses for a given biome type. For
   instance grasslands contribute greatly to global terrestrial C fluxes,
   and to date grassland warming experiments provide the opportunity to
   evaluate concurrent responses of both plant and soil C fluxes. Here, we
   compiled data from 70 sites (in total 622 observations) to evaluate the
   response of C fluxes to experimental warming across three grassland
   types (cold, temperate, and semi-arid), warming methods, and short (<= 3
   years) and longer-term (>3 years) experiment lengths. Overall, our
   meta-analysis revealed that experimental warming stimulated C fluxes in
   grassland ecosystems with regard to both plant production (e.g., net
   primary productivity (NPP) 15.4\%; aboveground NPP (ANPP) by 7.6\%,
   belowground NPP (BNPP) by 11.6\%) and soil respiration (Rs) (9.5\%).
   However, the magnitude of C flux stimulation varied significantly across
   cold, temperate and semi-arid grasslands, in that responses for most C
   fluxes were larger in cold than temperate or semi-arid ecosystems. In
   semi-arid and temperate grasslands, ecosystem respiration (Reco) was
   more sensitive to warming than gross primary productivity (GPP), while
   the opposite was observed for cold grasslands, where warming produced a
   net increase in whole-ecosystem C storage. However, the stimulatory
   effect of warming on ANPP and Rs observed in short-term studies (<= 3
   years) in both cold and temperate grasslands disappeared in longer-term
   experiments (>3 years). These results highlight the importance of
   conducting long-term warming experiments, and in examining responses
   across a wide range of climate.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-boundary fluxes of organisms and matter, termed ``subsidies,{''}
   are now recognized to be reciprocal and of roughly equal importance for
   both aquatic and terrestrial systems, even if terrestrial input to
   aquatic ecosystems has received most attention. The magnitude of
   aquatic-to-terrestrial subsidies is well documented, but the drivers
   behind these subsidies and their utilization by terrestrial consumers
   are characteristically local-scale studies, limiting the inferences that
   can be drawn for broader geographic scales. We therefore built and
   analyzed a database of stable isotope data extracted from 21 studies
   worldwide, to identify both landscape-scale (catchment) and local-scale
   (100-m riparian zone) variables that may affect the diet of terrestrial
   predators in riparian ecosystems. Our meta-analysis revealed a greater
   magnitude of aquatic-to-terrestrial subsidies (>50\%) than previously
   reported, albeit with large geographic and inter-annual variations.
   Moreover, we demonstrated a large effect of landscape-scale factors on
   aquaticto-terrestrial subsidies, particularly anthropogenic land use and
   tree cover. Local human population was the only relevant factor at the
   local scale. We also found that studies on landscape-scale and
   anthropogenic land use effects on aquatic-to-terrestrial subsidies are
   strongly under-represented in the ecological literature, which limits
   the general inferences that can currently be drawn about landscape
   effects. We suggest that landscape-scale studies could improve our
   understanding of how land use and environmental change might influence
   future patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem function.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in carbon dioxide (CO2), temperature, and precipitation can

   focused on how climate change impacts the performance of co-occurring
   native and introduced species. No synthesis has solely examined how
   invasive plant and animal species perform under climate change across
   both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. We asked the following questions:
   (1) How will combined and single climate change factors influence the
   performance of non-native species? (2) Which habitat types are more
   affected by climate factors in a combined or single manner? (3) What
   guilds/functional groups, within aquatic vs. terrestrial habitats, are
   more impacted by climate factors? To better understand this, we
   conducted a meta-analysis examining the relative influence climate
   change factors (carbon dioxide (CO2)/acidification, temperature,
   precipitation) have on invasive species' performance. Our results
   indicate that global change factors had an overall increased performance
   on invasive species in terrestrial habitats with an opposite effect
   observed in aquatic habitats. Plant functional groups were positively
   affected, whereas animal guilds were generally negatively impacted by
   global changes. Our findings suggest that while invasive taxa are
   affected differently by global changes, responses are confounded by

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Since the introduction of retention forestry in the 1990s, its practice
   has spread in the boreal and temperate regions. Its benefits for
   biodiversity are well recognised, and usually presented in the form of
   aggregated results for each taxonomic group. However, ameliorating
   effects of increased levels of retention on species with different
   ecological requirements is still not well studied. With this
   meta-analysis, we aim at disentangling the response of different bird
   guilds, considering the level of retention applied, as well as other
   confounding factors, such as the forest type or harvested area. We used
   a systematic review protocol and collected 30 studies which compared the
   response of birds to a gradient of retention levels against unharvested
   forests and/or clearcuts. Firstly, we compared the overall response of
   the full bird assemblage to retention, and found no differences in
   abundance and species richness between retention and unharvested forest,
   except for the abundance of some forest specialist species. Secondly,
   assessing the responses of various guilds showed that each bird guild
   can be affected very differently, according to their life history,
   biome, forest type and, most importantly, retention intensity. Results
   allow us to infer minimum retention levels needed to preserve each bird
   guild, admitting that other factors can play an important role in
   shaping the bird assemblage, often in interaction with retention. For
   example, canopy and cavity nesters showed a more positive response to
   lower levels of retention in mixed or broadleaved forests than in
   conifer forests. Our results indicate that minimum retention levels
   ranging between 40 and 60\% of original habitat are needed, in order to
   maintain the same bird assemblage as in the autochthonous unharvested
   forest, with particular regard to the forest specialists. (C) 2019 The

   has not been quantified in domestic animals as a risk factor with
   respect to latitude or parasite transmission pathway. Cats are an ideal
   model to test parasitic infection risk in outdoor animals because there
   have been many studies analysing this risk factor in this species; and
   there is a useful dichotomy in cat ownership between indoor-only cats
   and those with outdoor access. Thus, we used meta-analysis to determine
   whether outdoor access is a significant risk factor for parasitic
   infection in domestic pet cats across 19 different pathogens including
   many relevant to human, domestic animal and wildlife health, such as
   Toxoplasma gondii and Toxocara cati. Cats with outdoor access were 2.77
   times more likely to be infected with parasites than indoor-only cats.
   Furthermore, absolute latitude trended towards significance such that
   each degree increase in absolute latitude increased infection likelihood
   by 4\%. Thus, restricting outdoor access can reduce the risk of
   parasitic infection in cats and reduce the risk of zoonotic parasite
   transmission, spillover to sympatric wildlife and negative impacts on
   feline health.}},

Abstract = {{The virulence-transmission trade-off hypothesis proposed more than 30
   years ago is the cornerstone in the study of host-parasite co-evolution.
   This hypothesis rests on the premise that virulence is an unavoidable
   and increasing cost because the parasite uses host resources to
   replicate. This cost associated with replication ultimately results in a
   deceleration in transmission rate because increasing within-host
   replication increases host mortality. Empirical tests of predictions of
   the hypothesis have found mixed support, which cast doubt about its
   overall generalizability. To quantitatively address this issue, we
   conducted a meta-analysis of 29 empirical studies, after reviewing over
   6000 published papers, addressing the four core relationships between
   (1) virulence and recovery rate, (2) within-host replication rate and
   virulence, (3) within-host replication and transmission rate, and (4)
   virulence and transmission rate. We found strong support for an
   increasing relationship between replication and virulence, and
   replication and transmission. Yet, it is still uncertain if these
   relationships generally decelerate due to high within-study variability.
   There was insufficient data to quantitatively test the other two core
   relationships predicted by the theory. Overall, the results suggest that
   the current empirical evidence provides partial support for the
   trade-off hypothesis, but more work remains to bedone.}},

Volume = {{128}},

Abstract = {{Macrophytes are widely recognized for improving water quality and
   stabilizing the desirable clear-water state in lakes. The positive
   effects of macrophytes on water quality have been noted to be weaker in
   the (sub)tropics compared to those of temperate regions. We conducted a
   global meta-analysis using 47 studies that met our set criteria to
   assess the overall effects of macrophytes on water quality (measured by
   phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration, total nitrogen concentration,
   total phosphorus concentration, Secchi depth and the trophic state
   index) and to investigate how these effects correlate with latitude
   using meta-regressions. We also examined if the effects of macrophytes
   on lake-water quality differ with growth form and study design in
   (sub)tropical and temperate areas by grouping the data and then
   comparing the effect sizes. We found that macrophytes significantly
   reduced phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration, total nitrogen
   concentration, total phosphorus concentration, as well as the trophic
   state index, but they did not have a significant overall effect on
   Secchi depth. The effects of macrophytes on reducing phytoplankton
   chlorophyll a concentration, total nitrogen concentration and the
   trophic state index did not differ with latitude. However, the reduction
   of total phosphorus concentration was greater at lower latitudes. We
   showed that at lower latitudes, the positive effects of macrophytes on
   water quality are similar to or greater than those at higher latitudes,
   thus challenging the prevailing paradigm of macrophytes being less
   effective at enhancing lake-water quality in the (sub)tropics.
   Furthermore, our data showed that the macrophyte effects vary by growth
   forms, and the growth forms that positively affect water quality differ
   between the (sub)tropical and temperate areas. We showed a lack of
   significant macrophyte effects in surveys within and outside macrophyte
   stands, suggesting difference in the sensitivities of study designs or
   possibly weaker effects of macrophytes in lakes compared to experimental
   settings.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{351-360}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Unpredictable or variable ecosystem recovery from disturbance presents a
   challenge to conservation, particularly as the scale of human
   disturbance continues to increase. Theory suggests land-cover and
   disturbance characteristics affect recovery, but individual studies of
   disturbance and recovery frequently struggle to uncover generalizable
   patterns because of high levels of site-specific variation. To
   understand how land-cover, disturbance type, and disturbance duration
   influence ecosystem recovery, we used studies documenting recovery of 50
   streams to perform a global meta-analysis of stream recovery from
   disturbances that affect water quality (e.g., oil spill, fire,
   wastewater). We extracted upstream natural and urban land-cover
   percentages for each site and performed model selection and averaging to
   identify influences on recovery completeness. Most streams improved
   following the end of a disturbance (median 240\% of disturbed condition)
   but did not recover fully to baseline predisturbance condition within
   the studied period (median study period 2 years; median recovery 60\% of
   baseline). Scale of disturbance in time and space did not predict
   recovery, but sites with higher percentages of upstream natural land
   cover had less complete recovery relative to sites with more urban or
   agricultural cover, possibly due to higher baseline conditions in these
   streams. Our findings suggest impacts to systems with low anthropogenic
   stress may be more irreversible than impacts to already modified
   systems. We call for more long-term evaluations of ecosystem response to
   disturbance and the inclusion of regional references and predisturbance
   reference conditions for comparison. A more thorough understanding of
   the role of the surrounding landscape in shaping stream response to
   disturbance can help managers calibrate expectations for recovery and

Abstract = {{Irrigated maize production has increased in the world; however, a
   comprehensive assessment on how irrigation affects yield, water
   productivity (WP), and the environment under agricultural
   intensification on a global scale is paid little attention. In this
   study, we report the trade-offs among grain yield, WP, reactive nitrogen
   (N-r) losses, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in response to
   irrigation management using a global meta-analysis of field experimental
   data published in peer-reviewed journals prior to May 2018. A total of
   1490 paired data points from 162 publications and 21 counties showed
   that grain yield increased by 30.35\% from 7357 kg ha(-1) in non
   irrigated systems to 9512 kg ha(-1) in irrigation systems (146 mm).
   Similarly, WP increased by 9.91\% from 19.1 to 20.5 kg ha(-1) mm(-1).
   These increases in yield and WP varied depending on seasonal irrigation
   amounts, precipitation levels, annual average temperature, N
   application, soil organic matter, and bulk density. Based on 270
   peer-reviewed publications, the emission factors (EFs) of N-r losses in
   irrigation systems via NH3 emissions decreased by 9.3\%, N2O emissions
   decreased by 42.3\%, and NO3- leaching increased by 36.1\%, compared
   with non-irrigated systems. Calculated yield-scaled N-r losses decreased
   by 10.3\% from 5.94 kg N Mg-1 in non-irrigated systems to 5.32 kg N Mg-1
   in irrigated systems. Correspondingly, yield-scaled GHG emissions
   including field emissions; fossil fuel from irrigation pumping, N, P, K
   fertilizer production and transportation; and field management were
   22-28\% lower under irrigated conditions than non-irrigated system. This
   finding highlights the multiple benefits of protecting environments and
   improving WP through irrigation to attain higher maize yield. However,
   there are trade-offs to this approach, including increased leaching and
   the risk of a future water resource crisis.}},

   evidence}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Not all herbivory is detrimental to plants. In some cases, plants can
   compensate for herbivory, maintain growth and fitness following damage,
   or even overcompensate for herbivory and perform better than if left
   undamaged. Examples of overcompensation to vertebrate herbivory are well
   known, but here we review the literature for examples of reproductive
   overcompensation (i.e., increased production of traits associated with
   fitness) and increased vegetative growth (i.e., vegetative
   overcompensation) following insect herbivory. We used a meta-analysis to
   explore the effects of plant growth form, evolutionary history,
   herbivore feeding guild, and other plant and insect traits on the
   expression of reproductive and vegetative overcompensation by plants.
   Our literature search revealed 86 studies documenting examples of
   overcompensation for insect herbivory by 67 plant species representing
   26 families. These plants included monocots and dicots, annuals and
   perennials, and woody and herbaceous plants. We also found that varied
   insect herbivores induce overcompensation, including 75 insect species
   in six orders representing 27 families and myriad feeding guilds. In our
   meta-analysis, we calculated 53 effect sizes from 21 publications
   documenting reproductive overcompensation and 89 effect sizes from 40
   publications documenting vegetative overcompensation. Variation in
   reproductive overcompensation was seen among plant growth forms,
   functional groups, cultivation, herbivore feeding sites, and plant and
   herbivore families. Variation in vegetative overcompensation was seen
   among plant families, herbivore families, and latitudinal gradients. We
   suggest overcompensation for insect herbivory may be far more prevalent
   than previously thought. Additional research focusing on the mechanisms,
   patterns, and ecological and evolutionary consequences of
   overcompensation for insect herbivory is likely to provide exciting new
   insights into this poorly understood and largely overlooked outcome of
   plant-insect interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological research has increasingly highlighted the importance of
   intraspecific variation in shaping the structure and function of
   communities and ecosystems. Indeed, the effects of intraspecific
   variation can match or exceed those of interspecific variation. Previous
   reviews of intraspecific variation in plant traits across heterogeneous
   environments have focused primarily on mean phenotypic effects. We
   propose that a richer and fuller understanding of the ecological causes
   and consequences of intraspecific variation would be provided by
   partitioning trait variance into its subcomponents (genetic,
   environment, genotype by environment interaction). We used a
   meta-analysis of 352 sets of genetic, environment and genotype by
   environment (GxE) variation estimates from 72 studies of Salicaceae to
   compare these sources of variation across plant traits (growth, foliar
   nitrogen, defence compounds), insect herbivore performance metrics
   (e.g., survival, growth, fecundity) and environmental conditions (e.g.,
   soil nutrients, water, defoliation). Our findings revealed that
   variation in levels of defence compounds (both condensed tannins and
   salicinoids) and insect herbivore performance were primarily genetically
   determined, while variation in plant growth and foliar nitrogen was more
   environmentally determined. Plasticity in plant growth, foliar nitrogen
   levels and insect herbivore performance varied substantially across
   different sites (year x location), and nutrient, water and carbon
   dioxide environments. Plasticity was lowest for chemical defence traits
   and all traits in contrasting ozone and defoliation environments. Our
   quantitative review also revealed several gaps in the literature,
   including a need for surveying more mature plants, a wider variety of
   insect herbivore species (e.g., leaf-galling insects, specialist
   insects) and underrepresented environmental treatments (e.g.,
   competition, defoliation, disease, light and water availability).
   Findings from this analysis highlight the importance of, and patterns
   within, intraspecific variation with respect to shaping the evolvability
   and plasticity of traits and governing the interactions of plants and
   insects. A is available for this article.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1152-1170}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Interest in land application of organic amendments-such as biosolids,
   composts, and manures-is growing due to their potential to increase soil
   carbon and help mitigate climate change, as well as to support soil
   health and regenerative agriculture. While organic amendments are
   predominantly applied to croplands, their application is increasingly
   proposed on relatively arid rangelands that do not typically receive
   fertilizers or other inputs, creating unique concerns for outcomes such
   as native plant diversity and water quality. To maximize environmental
   benefits and minimize potential harms, we must understand how soil,
   water, and plant communities respond to particular amendments and site
   conditions. We conducted a global meta-analysis of 92 studies in which
   organic amendments had been added to arid, semiarid, or Mediterranean
   rangelands. We found that organic amendments, on average, provide some
   environmental benefits (increased soil carbon, soil water holding
   capacity, aboveground net primary productivity, and plant tissue
   nitrogen; decreased runoff quantity), as well as some environmental
   harms (increased concentrations of soil lead, runoff nitrate, and runoff
   phosphorus; increased soil CO2 emissions). Published data were
   inadequate to fully assess impacts to native plant communities. In our
   models, adding higher amounts of amendment benefitted four outcomes and
   harmed two outcomes, whereas adding amendments with higher nitrogen
   concentrations benefitted two outcomes and harmed four outcomes. This
   suggests that trade-offs among outcomes are inevitable; however,
   applying low-N amendments was consistent with both maximizing benefits
   and minimizing harms. Short study time frames (median 1-2 years),
   limited geographic scope, and, for some outcomes, few published studies
   limit longer-term inferences from these models. Nevertheless, they
   provide a starting point to develop site-specific amendment application
   strategies aimed toward realizing the potential of this practice to
   contribute to climate change mitigation while minimizing negative
   impacts on other environmental goals.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Experimental nitrogen (N) addition (fertilization) studies are
   commonly used to quantify the impacts of increased N inputs on plant
   biodiversity. However, given that plant community responses can vary
   considerably among individual studies, there is a clear need to
   synthesize and generalize findings with meta-analytical approaches. Our
   goal was to quantify changes in species richness and abundance in plant
   communities in response to N addition across different environmental
   contexts, while controlling for different experimental designs. Location
   Global. Time period Data range: 1985-2016; Publication years: 1990-2018.
   Major taxa studied Plants. Methods We performed a meta-analysis of 115
   experiments reported in 85 studies assessing the effects of N addition
   on terrestrial natural and semi-natural plant communities. We quantified
   local-scale changes in plant biodiversity in relationship to N addition
   using four metrics: species richness (SR), individual species abundance
   (IA), mean species abundance (MSA) and geometric mean abundance (GMA).
   Results For all metrics, greater amounts of annual N addition resulted
   in larger declines in plant diversity. Additionally, MSA decreased more
   steeply with N that was applied in reduced (NH4+) rather than oxidized
   (NO3-) form. Loss of SR with increasing amounts of N was found to be
   larger in warmer sites. Furthermore, greater losses of SR were found in
   sites with longer experimental durations, smaller plot sizes and lower
   soil cation exchange capacity. Finally, reductions in the abundance of
   individual species were larger for N-sensitive plant life-form types
   (legumes and non-vascular plants). Main conclusions N enrichment
   decreases both SR and abundance of plants in N-addition experiments, but
   the magnitude of the response differs among biodiversity metrics and
   with the environmental and experimental context. This underlines the
   importance of integrating multiple dimensions of biodiversity and
   relevant modifying factors into assessments of biodiversity responses to
   global environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{The exponential increase in species introductions during the
   Anthropocene has brought about a major loss of biodiversity. Amphibians
   have suffered large declines, with more than 16\% considered to be

   the impacts of alien species on native amphibians to determine which
   aspects of amphibian ecology are most affected by plant, invertebrate,
   fish, amphibian, reptile, or mammal introductions. Measures of fitness
   were most strongly affected; amphibian performance was consistently
   lower in the presence of alien species. While exposure to alien species
   caused a significant decrease in amphibian behavioural activity when
   compared with a no species control, this response was stronger towards a

Title = {{A meta-analysis shows that seaweeds surpass plants, setting
   life-on-Earth's limit for biomass packing}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{JAN 31}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundAs plants, algae and some sessile invertebrates may grow in
   nearly monospecific assemblies, their collective biomass increases and
   if they compete hard enough some die, freeing up space. The concurrent
   increase in biomass and decrease in density is called self-thinning, and
   its trajectory over time or maximum values represent a boundary
   condition. For a single stand developing over time the boundary defines
   the carrying capacity of the environment but the most extreme
   trajectories emulate the efficiency of species in packing biomass into
   space.ResultsHere we present a meta-analysis of compiled data on biomass
   and density from 56 studies of 42 species of seaweeds from 8 orders
   within 3 phyla scattered through the world's oceans. Our analysis shows
   that, with respect to biomass, seaweeds are the most efficient space
   occupiers on Earth because they transgress previously fixed limits
   derived from land plants. This is probably because seaweeds are not
   limited by water and do not need structures for its transport or for
   transpiration; they photosynthesise and uptake nutrients over their
   entire surface; they are attached to the substrate by holdfasts that are
   small proportional to their volume or weight compared to roots; water
   provides them better support, reducing the need for tissues for
   rigidity. We also identified a biomass concentration common to plants
   and seaweeds which represents the threshold that no life on the planet
   can pass. Using each stand's distance to the biomass-density boundary,
   we determined that within the seaweeds the efficiency of space
   occupation differed amongst taxonomic and functional groups as well as
   with clonality and latitude.ConclusionsAlgae occupy space more
   efficiently than plants, most likely because the watery environment
   facilitates the physical processes and integration of space occupation.
   The distance-to-the-boundary proves a good metric to discriminate among
   groups and may be useful for comparison of the most efficient biomass
   producing systems, or for the identification of systems impacted by
   pollution.}},

Abstract = {{Mutualism is a fundamental relationship that can shape species
   communities through co-evolutionary adaptations and also has great
   ability to change ecosystem functions. Aphids and ants are common insect
   groups which are distributed widely across the world. The mutualistic

   However, very few studies have been carried out on the diversity of
   associated aphid and ant species pairs. In this study, we tried to
   gather available published data about the diversity of species pairs of
   aphids and ants to find out potential ecological and geographical
   patterns. The results showed that 284 species of aphids belonging to 83
   genera and 9 subfamilies were mutualistically associated with 193
   species of ants belonging to 38 genera and 4 subfamilies. In this report
   we elucidated a total of 972 aphid-ant interactions and 915 ant-aphid
   interactions (one aphid species may associate with many ant species and
   vice versa). Among these relationships, a highest number of ant species
   were associated with the aphid genus Aphis, while a highest number of
   aphids were associated with the ant genus Formica. Besides, an obvious
   geographical pattern was indicated that the subtropical region may have
   a higher diversity of aphid-ant associations. This global analysis of
   current knowledge about diversity and patterns of aphid-ant mutualistic
   relationships also indicates that more taxonomic and ecological studies
   are needed to enrich our understanding of these associations.}},

Abstract = {{Metabarcoding has been used in a range of ecological applications such

   structured review and meta-analysis. The analysis suggests that a weak
   quantitative relationship may exist between the biomass and sequences
   produced (slope = 0.52 +/- 0.34, p < 0.01), albeit with a large degree
   of uncertainty. None of the tested moderators, sequencing platform type,
   the number of species used in a trial or the source of DNA, were able to
   explain the variance. Our current understanding of the factors affecting
   the quantitative performance of metabarcoding is still limited:
   additional research is required before metabarcoding can be confidently

Abstract = {{Fragmentation of agricultural landscape is considered as a threat to
   biodiversity of many important habitats around the world. Change to the
   use of land causing loss, isolation and degradation of ecosystems, is
   one of the main subjects of study in the field of ecology and
   conservation biology. An appropriate and complex analysis of factors
   shaping species diversity of the objects in fragmented agricultural
   landscape may contribute to the understanding and limiting the negative
   impact of this phenomenon on biocenosis. This paper is a meta-analysis
   in order to determine the applied research methods and a synthetic
   representation of the impact of landscape fragmentation on various
   spatial objects. The aim of the study was to analyse the main assumption
   of The Theory of Island Biogeography which states that with the decrease
   of the area of objects, their biodiversity will decrease, while their
   isolation will increase. An attempt was also made to assess the impact
   of particular factors that may affect the plant species richness in
   given objects. The meta-analysis was carried out on the basis of
   selected criteria for 41 scientific articles in European countries. It
   was assumed that one cannot unequivocally state the correctness of
   applying this theory to any type of objects. The conducted study
   indicated that usually the greatest positive influence on phytodiversity
   has the size of a given patch, while isolation was assigned a negative
   impact. The review of landscape research confirmed the thesis that the
   surface and isolation cannot be unambiguously determined to shape
   biodiversity in the patches.}},

Abstract = {{Although there are several alternative approaches to conventional
   fanning for the nexus of food and biodiversity, the effects of different
   land management regimes on biodiversity conservation and agricultural
   production have not been fully evaluated. Focusing on orchard and
   vineyard landscapes, which host many conservation-priority species, we
   conducted a series of meta-analyses to compare (1) three measures of
   biodiversity (taxon richness, abundance, and community similarity) among
   five management regimes (conventional, integrated, organic, and
   abandoned orchards/vineyards and (semi -)natural habitats) and (2)
   fruit/nut yield among the three fanning systems. Compared to
   conventional fanning, integrated farming supported higher richness (on
   average +11\%) and a slightly lower yield (-1\%). The lack of positive
   effect on overall abundance was due to the increase in natural enemies
   and the decrease in pests. Organic farming showed greater richness and
   abundance (+16\% and +51\%, respectively) and a significantly lower
   yield (-18\%). (Semi -)natural habitats and abandoned orchards/vineyards
   showed less similar community compositions to conventional
   orchards/vineyards than to integrated ones. Our study provides the
   differential effects of management regimes as alternatives to
   conventional fanning on biodiversity conservation and fruit/nut
   production. Future studies should explore whether a combined use of land
   sharing (integrated and organic farming) and land sparing, including the
   preservation of old orchards, is a better strategy than either land
   sharing or sparing for conserving biodiversity on multiple spatial
   scales with a minimal loss in food production. This is particularly true
   for Asia, where large areas of orchards remain poorly investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Rising air temperature and changing precipitation patterns already
   strongly influence forest ecosystems, yet large-scale patterns of
   belowground root trait variation and their underlying drivers are poorly
   understood. Here, we investigated general patterns of root tip
   adjustments within fine-root systems and the potential ecological
   implications of these patterns. Location Global. Methods We synthesize
   key fine-root traits related to resource acquisition and determined
   their responses along climate and edaphic gradients. We specifically
   identified patterns of root tip abundance (number of root tips per dry
   biomass of fine roots <= 2 mm in diameter), and root tip density (number
   of root tips per soil volume) among angiosperm and gymnosperm trees to
   climate, edaphic gradients and stand properties. Results We found that
   angiosperm trees, which were more common in warmer, sometimes drier
   climates with more fertile soil, formed more root tips (higher root tip
   abundance, root tip density and higher slope of root tip density vs.
   fine-root biomass) than gymnosperm trees, which lived in cooler, wetter
   climates with poor soil. Angiosperm and gymnosperm trees exhibited
   opposing trends in response to gradients in climate as gymnosperm trees
   tended to decrease root tip abundance and root tip density but
   alternatively increase mycorrhizal mycelial biomass with increasing
   MAT/MAP (ratio of mean annual temperature to mean annual precipitation),
   while angiosperm trees tended to increase root tip abundance and root
   tip density with increasing MAT/MAP. However, the individual trends of
   root tip abundance and root tip density for angiosperm and gymnosperm
   trees to MAT or MAP were more similar and often non-significant. Main
   conclusions These results suggest disparate carbon or biomass adjustment
   strategies within gymnosperm and angiosperm tree fine-root systems along
   climate gradients. Differences in angiosperm and gymnosperm tree
   adjustments in their fine-root systems to changing environments have
   implications for how these plant groups are likely to perform in

Abstract = {{Floral traits are hypothesized to evolve primarily in response to
   selection by pollinators. However, selection can also be mediated by
   other environmental factors. To understand the relative importance of
   pollinator-mediated selection and its variation among trait and
   pollinator types, we analyzed directional selection gradients on floral
   traits from experiments that manipulated the environment to identify
   agents of selection. Pollinator-mediated selection was stronger than
   selection by other biotic factors (e.g., herbivores), but similar in
   strength to selection by abiotic factors (e.g., soil water), providing
   partial support for the hypothesis that floral traits evolve primarily
   in response to pollinators. Pollinator-mediated selection was stronger
   on pollination efficiency traits than on other trait types, as expected
   if efficiency traits affect fitness via interactions with pollinators,
   but other trait types also affect fitness via other environmental
   factors. In addition to varying among trait types, pollinator-mediated
   selection varied among pollinator taxa: selection was stronger when
   bees, long-tongued flies, or birds were the primary visitors than when
   the primary visitors were Lepidoptera or multiple animal taxa. Finally,
   reducing pollinator access to flowers had a relatively small effect on
   selection on floral traits, suggesting that anthropogenic declines in

Abstract = {{Theory predicts that parents adjust the sex ratio of their brood to the
   sexually selected traits of their mate because the reproductive success
   of sons may be more dependent on inherited paternal attractiveness than
   that of daughters. Empirical studies vary in terms of whether they
   support the theory, and this variation has often been regarded as
   evidence against sex ratio adjustment or has been ascribed to
   methodological differences. Applying phylogenetic meta-analyses, we
   aimed to find biological explanations for the variation observed in
   songbirds. In particular, we tested the role extra-pair paternity,
   because infidelity occurs in the majority of these species and may
   reduce the adaptive value of adjusting brood sex ratio to the phenotype
   of the social mate. However, we found that the variation in effect sizes
   was unrelated to the proportion of extra-pair paternity. Thus future
   studies should consider that mate quality dependent sex ratio adjustment
   may be driven by direct (material) rather than indirect (genetic)
   benefits. We also tested if the effect sizes are influenced by whether
   the focal male trait is indeed under sexual selection as it is assumed
   by the sex allocation theory. We found that for male traits with proven
   role in sexual selection, effect sizes significantly differed from the
   null expectation of random production of sons and daughters. For male
   traits with only presumed sexual role in sexual selection, the deviation
   from the null expectation was less convincing, and the effect sizes were
   significantly smaller. This result indicates that studies that neglect
   the assumptions of the hypotheses concerned, may lead to the
   underestimation of the mean effect size and, eventually, false
   conclusions.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Support for the ``biotic resistance hypothesis,{''} that species-rich
   communities are more successful at resisting invasion by exotic species
   than are species-poor communities, has long been debated. It has been
   argued that native-exotic richness relationships (NERR) are negative at
   small spatial scales and positive at large scales, but evidence for the
   role of spatial scale on NERR has been contradictory. However, no formal
   quantitative synthesis has previously examined whether NERR is
   scale-dependent across multiple studies, and previous studies on NERR
   have not distinguished spatial grain and extent, which may drive very
   different ecological processes. We used a global systematic review and
   hierarchical mixed-effects meta-analysis to provide a comprehensive
   quantitative assessment of the patterns of NERR over a range of spatial
   grain sizes and spatial extents, based on 204 individual cases of
   observational (non-experimental) NERRs from 101 publications. We show
   that NERR was indeed highly scale dependent across studies and increased
   with the log of grain size. However, mean NERR was not negative at any
   grain size, although there was high heterogeneity at small grain sizes.
   We found no clear patterns of NERR across different spatial extents,
   suggesting that extent plays a less important role in determining NERR
   than does grain, although there was a complex interaction between extent
   and grain size. Almost all studies on NERR were conducted in North
   America, western Europe, and a few other regions, with little
   information on tropical or Arctic regions. We did find that NERR
   increased northward in temperate regions and also varied with longitude.
   We discuss possible explanations for the patterns we found, and caution
   that our results do not show that invasive species are benign or have no
   negative consequences for biodiversity preservation. This study
   represents the first global quantitative analysis of scale-based NERR,
   and casts doubt on the existence of an ``invasion paradox{''} of
   negative NERR at small scales and positive correlations at large scales

Abstract = {{Invasive plants affect soil biota through litter and rhizosphere inputs,
   but the direction and magnitude of these effects are variable. We
   conducted a meta-analysis to examine the different effects of litter and
   rhizosphere of invasive plants on soil communities and nutrient cycling.
   Our results showed that invasive plants increased bacterial biomass by
   16\%, detritivore abundance by 119\% and microbivore abundance by 89\%
   through litter pathway. In the rhizosphere, invasive plants reduced
   bacterial biomass by 12\%, herbivore abundance by 55\% and predator
   abundance by 52\%, but increased AM fungal biomass by 36\%. Moreover,
   CO2 efflux, N mineralisation rate and enzyme activities were all higher
   in invasive than native rhizosphere soils. These findings indicate that
   invasive plants may support more decomposers that in turn stimulate
   nutrient release via litter effect, and enhance nutrient uptake by
   reducing root grazing but forming more symbioses in the rhizosphere.
   Thus, we hypothesise that litter- and root-based loops are probably
   linked to generate positive feedback of invaders on soil systems through
   stimulating nutrient cycling, consequently facilitating plant invasion.
   Our findings from limited cases with diverse contexts suggest that more
   studies are needed to differentiate litter and rhizosphere effects

Abstract = {{Restoration of deforested and degraded landscapes is a globally
   recognized strategy to sequester carbon, improve ecological integrity,
   conserve biodiversity, and provide additional benefits to human health
   and well-being. Investment in riparian forest restoration has received
   relatively little attention, in part due to their relatively small
   spatial extent. Yet, riparian forest restoration may be a particularly
   valuable strategy because riparian forests have the potential for rapid
   carbon sequestration, are hotspots of biodiversity, and provide numerous
   valuable ecosystem services. To inform this strategy, we conducted a
   global synthesis and meta-analysis to identify general patterns of
   carbon stock accumulation in riparian forests. We compiled riparian
   biomass and soil carbon stock data from 117 publications, reports, and
   unpublished data sets. We then modeled the change in carbon stock as a
   function of vegetation age, considering effects of climate and whether
   or not the riparian forest had been actively planted. On average, our
   models predicted that the establishment of riparian forest will more
   than triple the baseline, unforested soil carbon stock, and that
   riparian forests hold on average 68-158 Mg C/ha in biomass at maturity,
   with the highest values in relatively warm and wet climates. We also
   found that actively planting riparian forest substantially jump-starts
   the biomass carbon accumulation, with initial growth rates more than
   double those of naturally regenerating riparian forest. Our results
   demonstrate that carbon sequestration should be considered a strong
   co-benefit of riparian restoration, and that increasing the pace and
   scale of riparian forest restoration may be a valuable investment
   providing both immediate carbon sequestration value and long-term
   ecosystem service returns.}},

   NT-induced changes in crop yield and greenhouse gas (GHG, i.e. CH4, CO2,
   and N2O) emissions. Such trade-offs are regulated by climate
   fluctuations and heterogeneous soil conditions and have not been well
   addressed. Supporting CSA management decisions requires advancing our
   understanding of how NT affects crop yield and GHG emissions in
   different agroecological regions. In this study, a meta-analysis was
   conducted using 740 paired measurements from 90 peer-reviewed articles
   to assess the effects of NT on crop yield, GHG emissions, and the global
   warming potential (GWP) of major cereal cropping systems. Compared to
   conventional tillage (CT), NT reduced in GHG emissions and increased
   crop yield in dry, but not humid, climates, and reduced in the GWP at
   sites with acidic soils. Across different cropping systems, NT enhanced
   barley yield by 49\%, particularly in dry climates, and it decreased the
   GWP of rice fields through a 22\% reduction in both CO2 and CH4
   emissions. Our synthesis suggests that NT is an effective CSA management
   practice because of its potential for climate change mitigation and crop
   yield improvement. However, the net effect of NT (relative to CT) was
   influenced by several environmental and agronomic factors (climatic
   conditions, tillage duration, soil texture, pH, crop species).
   Therefore, agroecological setting must be taken into consideration when
   conducting a comparative evaluation of different tillage practices.}},

Abstract = {{Farmland abandonment is increasing worldwide. Concurrently, some
   conservationists view this as an opportunity for biodiversity
   restoration (i.e., rewilding). Due to a lack of data, however, it
   remains unclear whether farmland abandonment increases biodiversity in
   different farmland types and surrounding environments. Information is
   particularly scarce for Asia, home to one-third of identified
   biodiversity hotspots and where dominant farmlands (i.e., rice fields)
   are often viewed as substitutes for natural wetlands. We conducted the
   first meta-analysis of the impacts of rice-field abandonment on
   biodiversity, in which we considered multiscale factors, such as taxon
   surveyed, landscape context, and climate. Species richness and abundance
   after abandonment decreased to 56-72\%. This reduced biodiversity was
   unlikely to recover, at least for plant species richness, even after
   10-15 years. These results suggest rewilding will not necessarily be
   achieved by rice-field abandonment. Moreover, there was a pronounced
   biodiversity decline under dry conditions (e.g., low precipitation),
   especially for organisms closely associated with aquatic environment,
   such as amphibians and fish. Biodiversity reduction was least pronounced
   for birds and mammals. Such context dependency may suggest that impacts
   of farmland abandonment can be predicted by considering biological
   features of organisms and their associations with human-modified
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Body condition metrics are widely used to infer animal health and to
   assess costs of parasite infection. Since parasites harm their hosts,
   ecologists might expect negative relationships between infection and
   condition in wildlife, but this assumption is challenged by studies
   showing positive or null condition-infection relationships. Here, we
   outline common condition metrics used by ecologists in studies of
   parasitism, and consider mechanisms that cause negative, positive, and

   perform a meta-analysis of 553 condition-infection relationships from

   relationships, a small, negative average effect size that is stronger in

   relationships. The strongest predictors of variation in study outcomes
   are host thermoregulation and the methods used to evaluate body

Abstract = {{Agricultural soils play an important role in the atmospheric methane
   (CH4) budget, where paddy soils can contribute significant CH4 to
   atmosphere whereas upland soils may act as a source or sink of
   atmospheric CH4, dependent on soil water conditions. Biochar amendments
   have effects on soil CH4 production or oxidation processes in individual
   experiments, but the causative mechanisms are yet to be fully
   elucidated. To synthesize the response of soil CH4 release or uptake to
   biochar amendment, we performed a meta-analysis using data from 61
   peer-reviewed papers with 222 updated paired measurements. When averaged
   across all studies, biochar amendment significantly decreased CH4
   release rates by 12\% for paddy soils and 72\% for upland soils, and CH4
   uptake rates by 84\% for upland soils. Neither soil CH4 release nor
   uptake responses to biochar amendment were significant in field soils.
   Nitrogen (N) fertilizer application would weaken the response of soil
   CH4 release or uptake to biochar amendment. Biochar-incurred decreases
   in soil CH4 release and uptake rates were the largest in medium-textured
   soils or neutral-pH soils. Soil CH4 release or uptake responses to
   biochar were also significantly altered by biochar characteristics, such
   as feedstock source, C/N ratio, pH, and pyrolysis temperature. The
   results of this synthesis suggest that the role of biochar in soil CH4
   mitigation potential might have been exaggerated, particularly in fields
   when biochar is applied in combination with N fertilizer.}},

   a meta-analysis of 58 peer reviewed, published data source on soil BNE
   from cropland fields across China, representing a range of climate and
   soil types. Mean soil BNE rate in croplands was estimated at 0.93 kg N

   rate was in the north subtropical zone (1.66 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and the
   lowest in the cold temperate zone (0.53 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). We
   estimated total national BNE for China based on the BNE rates for the

   Agriculture or Agroforest vs. Pasture, SOC stocks under AFS were higher

   -5.3\% in the TEM in the 0-100 cm soil depth. The Agroforest aged

   up to 100 cm soil depth, whereas SOC stock under AFS was lower than
   under Forest. The results suggest that a general pattern of Forest -
   Agroforest - Agriculture - Pasture continuum could be expected in SOC
   stock decline during land-use changes. Improvement of SOC stocks under
   AFS varied across agroecological regions, the highest being under arid

Abstract = {{Human-caused shifts in carbon (C) cycling and biotic exchange are
   defining characteristics of the Anthropocene. In marine systems,
   saltmarsh, seagrass, and mangrove habitats-collectively known as ``blue
   carbon{''} and coastal vegetated habitats (CVHs)-are a leading sequester
   of global C and increasingly impacted by exotic species invasions. There
   is growing interest in the effect of invasion by a diverse pool of
   exotic species on C storage and the implications for ecosystem-based
   management of these systems. In a global meta-analysis, we synthesized
   data from 104 papers that provided 345 comparisons of habitat-level
   response (plant and soil C storage) from paired invaded and uninvaded
   sites. We found an overall net effect of significantly higher C pools in
   invaded CVHs amounting to 40\% (+/- 16\%) higher C storage than
   uninvaded habitat, but effects differed among types of invaders.
   Elevated C storage was driven by blue C-forming plant invaders
   (saltmarsh grasses, seagrasses, and mangrove trees) that intensify
   biomass per unit area, extend and elevate coastal wetlands, and convert
   coastal mudflats into C-rich vegetated habitat. Introduced animal and
   structurally distinct primary producers had significant negative effects
   on C pools, driven by herbivory, trampling, and native species
   displacement. The role of invasion manifested differently among habitat
   types, with significant C storage increases in saltmarshes, decreases in
   seagrass, and no significant effect in mangroves. There were also
   counter-directional effects by the same species in different systems or
   locations, which underscores the importance of combining data mining
   with analyses of mean effect sizes in meta-analyses. Our study provides
   a quantitative basis for understanding differential effects of invasion
   on blue C habitats and will inform conservation strategies that need to
   balance management decisions involving invasion, C storage, and a range
   of other marine biodiversity and habitat functions in these coastal

Abstract = {{1. Autonomous sound recording is a promising sampling method for birds
   and other vocalizing terrestrial wildlife. However, while there are
   clear advantages of passive acoustic monitoring methods over classical
   point counts conducted by humans, it has been difficult to
   quantitatively assess how they compare in their sampling performance.
   Quantitative comparisons of species richness between acoustic recorders
   and human point counts in bird surveys have previously been hampered by
   the differing and often unknown detection ranges or sound detection
   spaces among sampling methods.
   2. We performed two meta-analyses based on 28 studies where bird point
   counts were paired with sound recordings at the same sampling sites. We
   compared alpha and gamma richness estimated by both survey methods after
   equalizing their effective detection ranges. We further assessed the
   influence of technical sound recording specifications (microphone
   signal-to-noise ratio, height and number) on the bird sampling
   performance of sound recorders compared to unlimited radius point
   counts.
   3. We show that after standardizing detection ranges, alpha and gamma
   richness from both methods are statistically indistinguishable, while
   there might be an avoidance effect in point counts. Furthermore, we show
   that microphone signal-to-noise ratio (a measure of its quality), height
   and number positively affect performance through increasing the
   detection range, allowing sound recorders to match the performance of
   human point counts.
   4. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate that when used properly,
   high-end sound recording systems can sample terrestrial wildlife just as
   well as human observers conducting point counts. Correspondingly, we
   suggest a first standard methodology for sampling birds with autonomous
   sound recorders to obtain results comparable to point counts and enable
   practical sampling. We also give recommendations for carrying out
   effective surveys and making the most out of autonomous sound recorders.}},

   ecosystem. The meta-analysis further showed no significant responses of
   soil enzyme activities to climate warming and nutrient additions across
   the Tibetan grasslands. Our findings indicate that soil extracellular
   enzymes are resistant to the major environmental changes in the Tibetan
   alpine grasslands with extreme environments. Thereby, accurate
   predictions of soil microbial responses to environmental changes require
   a thorough understanding of the soil microbial adaptation to the alpine
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Heretofore, no study has determined how germination of ingested seeds is
   affected by the kind (class) of dormancy nor by seed dormancy x seed
   size interaction. Thus, we aimed to determine the effects of seed size,
   kind of dormancy and their interaction on germination of defecated seeds
   using a meta-analysis. We collected data for 366 plant species in 97
   plant families from 76 publications. In general, gut passage
   significantly increased germination percentage of defecated seeds by 5\%
   compared with that of control seeds. Germination percentages of
   non-dormant, physiologically dormant, and
   morphologically/morphophysiologically dormant seeds (all
   water-permeable) significantly decreased after gut passage by 40, 18,
   and 14\%, respectively, compared with control seeds (non-gut-passed).
   Changes in germination percentage of seeds with physical dormancy
   (water-impermeable) were positive, and gut passage increased germination
   by 69\% compared with control seeds. Germination of small seeds
   decreased 8\% after gut passage, whereas germination of both medium and
   large seeds increased by 18\%. However, changes in germination
   percentage differed between categories of seed size in each class of
   dormancy. In physically dormant seeds, germination of all seed sizes
   improved after gut passage, and the magnitude of increase was higher for
   large than for medium and small seeds. Thus, gut passage increased
   germination of medium-size water-permeable seeds (physiologically
   dormant and morphologically/morphophysiologically dormant) more than it
   did for large and small seeds. However, gut-passage decreased or did not
   change the germination percentage of non-dormant seeds. Seed size and
   kind of dormancy should be included in studies on the effect of gut
   passage on germination.}},

Abstract = {{As has been widely reported, climate change will be felt throughout
   Europe, though effects are likely to vary dramatically across European
   regions. While all areas are expected to experience elevated atmospheric
   CO2 concentrations (up arrow C) and higher temperatures (up arrow T),
   the north east will get considerably wetter (up arrow W) while the south
   much drier (down arrow W). It is likely that these changes will have an
   impact on pastures and consequently on grazing livestock. This study
   aims to evaluate the expected changes to pasture yield and quality
   caused by up arrow C, up arrow T, up arrow W and down arrow W across the
   different European regions and across different plant functional groups
   (PFGs). Data was collected from 143 studies giving a total of 998
   observations. Mixed models were used to estimate expected changes in
   above ground dry weight (AGDW) and nitrogen (N) concentrations and were
   implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations. The results
   showed an increase in AGDW under up arrow C, particularly for shrubs
   (+71.6\%), though this is likely to be accompanied by a reduction in N
   concentrations (-4.8\%). up arrow T will increase yields in Alpine and
   northern areas (+82.6\%), though other regions will experience little
   change or else decreases. up arrow T will also reduce N concentrations,
   especially for shrubs (-13.6\%) and forbs (-18.5\%). down arrow W will
   decrease AGDW for all regions and PFGs, though will increase N
   concentrations (+11.7\%). Under up arrow W there was a 33.8\% increase
   in AGDW. While there is a need for further research to get a more
   complete picture of future pasture conditions, this analysis provides a
   general overview of expected changes and thus can help European farmers
   prepare to adapt their systems to meet the challenges presented by a
   changing climate.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Habitat loss and fragmentation are among the biggest threats to
   biodiversity. Anthropogenic habitat fragmentation leads to small and
   isolated remnant plant and animal populations. The combination of
   increased random genetic drift, inbreeding, and reduced gene flow may
   substantially reduce genetic variation of remnant populations. However,
   the magnitude of these responses may depend on several poorly understood
   factors including organism group, habitat type of both the fragment and
   the surrounding matrix, life-history traits, and time since
   fragmentation. We compiled data for 83 plant and 52 animal species and
   conducted a meta-analysis following best practices to evaluate how these
   factors mediate the effects of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. We
   calculated 206 effect sizes as correlations between one of four measures
   of population-level genetic diversity and fragment area. All analyses
   were repeated using models of increasing complexity (traditional
   random-effects models, multilevel models accounting for non-independent
   data, and multilevel models additionally correcting for phylogenetic
   relatedness). We confirmed that anthropogenic habitat fragmentation has
   overall negative effects on genetic diversity of organisms. Our
   meta-analysis shows, however, that plant species responded in general
   stronger to fragmentation than animal species and that the largest
   negative impacts of fragmentation occurred in tropical and temperate
   forest fragments, surrounded by a non-forest matrix. In contrast, we
   found only weak responses in non-forest fragments. Genetic diversity
   measured as mean number of alleles (A) showed the strongest response to
   fragmentation. Expected heterozygosity (He) and percentage of
   polymorphic loci (PLP) showed similar but weaker responses. In contrast,
   our meta-analysis indicated that inbreeding (Fis) was not measurably
   affected by anthropogenic habitat fragmentation. Additionally, our
   models revealed that effects on genetic diversity became stronger with
   age of fragments: We found significant negative responses for fragments
   older than 50 yr but not for those more recently isolated. Our
   meta-analyses also showed that currently animals are underrepresented in
   the literature on genetic effects of anthropogenic fragmentation, as are
   certain geographical regions and habitat types. We expect that future
   field studies using state-of-the-art approaches will provide further
   evidence of negative genetic effects, which may reinforce the here
   reported patterns, even for groups not yet studied.}},

Abstract = {{To date, there are a high volume of studies concerning climate change
   impact assessments in ecosystems. Meta-analysis, scenario development,
   and causal chains/loops have been used as tools in these assessments as
   well as in decision making either individually or combined in pairs.
   There exists a need to develop decision support tools that improve the
   linkage between climate-impacts research and planning, management,
   adaptation, and mitigation decisions by providing quantitative and
   timely information to stakeholders and managers. The overall goal is to
   address this need. A specific objective was to develop a decision
   support tool in eco-hydrological applications that combine three
   components: meta-analysis, scenario development, and causal chains/loop.
   The developed tool is novel, warranted, and timely. The use of the tool
   is demonstrated for Florida. The meta-analysis of 32 studies revealed
   precipitation changes ranged between +30\% and -40\%, and temperature
   changes ranged from +6 degrees C to -3 degrees C for Florida. Seven
   incremental scenarios were developed at 10\% increments in the
   precipitation change range and nine scenarios with 1 degrees C
   increments in the temperature change range (driving forces). The causal
   chains/loops were developed using Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response
   framework for selected ecosystems and environment (e.g., agroecosystem,
   mangroves, water resources, and sea turtles) in Florida. The driving
   force puts pressure on the ecosystem or environment impacting their
   state, which in turn had a response (e.g., mitigation and adaptation
   strategies). The framework used indicators selected from studies on
   climate impact assessments (meta-analysis and others) for the selected
   ecosystems as well as author expertise on the topic to develop the
   chains/loops. The decision tool is applicable to stakeholders and any
   ecosystem within and outside of Florida.}},

Abstract = {{Non-native organisms are an abundant component of almost all global
   ecosystems. A prominent framework to explain the success of non-native
   plants is the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA)
   hypothesis. EICA predicts that plants escape from co-evolved herbivores
   after introduction into a non-native habitat. Assuming limited
   resources, a relaxation in selection pressures for resistance traits
   against the co-evolved specialist herbivores allows plants to allocate
   increased resources to traits related to fitness and/or competitive
   ability. Despite the prominence of the EICA hypothesis in the
   literature, empirical evidence has been mixed. We conducted a
   meta-analysis on 30 studies that focused on genetic-based trait
   variation and the trade-off between resistance traits and fitness to
   assess support for the EICA hypothesis. We found general support for
   EICA across studies. Performance of herbivores was higher on non-native
   plant populations than on native populations of the same species.
   Fitness trait values were higher in non-native populations, relative to
   native, and we found evidence for trade-offs between herbivore
   performance and plant fitness traits. Support for EICA was strongest
   when we focused on direct measurements of herbivore performance, and
   weakest when we assessed resistance traits, highlighting the complex and
   often unknown relationship between resistance traits and particular

Abstract = {{Traits-based approaches in microbial ecology provide a valuable way to
   abstract organismal interaction with the environment and to generate
   hypotheses about community function. Using macromolecular rate theory
   (MMRT), we recently identified that temperature sensitivity can be
   characterized as a distinct microbial trait. As temperature is
   fundamental in controlling biological reactions, variation in
   temperature sensitivity across communities, organisms, and processes has
   the potential to vastly improve understanding of microbial response to
   climate change. These microbial temperature sensitivity traits include
   the heat capacity (<mml:msubsup>CP double dagger</mml:msubsup>),
   temperature optimum (T-opt), and point of maximum temperature
   sensitivity (TSmax), each of which provide unique insights about
   organismal response to changes in temperature. In this meta-analysis, we
   analyzed the distribution of these temperature sensitivity traits from
   bacteria, fungi, and mixed communities across a variety of biological
   systems (e.g., soils, oceans, foods, wastewater treatment plants) in
   order to identify commonalities in temperature responses across these
   diverse organisms and reaction rates. Our analysis of temperature
   sensitivity traits from over 350 temperature response curves reveals a
   wide distribution of temperature sensitivity traits, with T-opt and
   TSmax well within biological relevant temperatures. We find that traits
   vary significantly depending on organism type, microbial diversity,
   source environment, and biological process, with higher temperature
   sensitivity found in fungi than bacteria and in less diverse systems.
   Carbon dioxide production was found to be less temperature sensitive
   than denitrification, suggesting that changes in temperature will have a
   potentially larger impact on nitrogen-related processes. As climate
   changes, these results have important implications for basic
   understanding of the temperature sensitivity of biological reactions and
   for ecological understanding of species' trait distributions, as well as
   for improved treatment of temperature sensitivity in models.}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   We examined potential environmental drivers of broad-scale spatial
   patterns in the trophic structure of marine ecosystems as represented by
   nitrogen stable isotopes in globally distributed marine predators.
   Additionally, we assessed the effects of spatial scale on the predictive
   capabilities of environmental variables.
   LocationTime periodGlobal oceans.
   2000 to 2015.
   Major taxa studiedMethodsTunas: Thunnus albacares, Thunnus obesus,
   Thunnus alalunga.
   We undertook a global compilation and meta-analysis of the bulk nitrogen
   stable isotope ratios (N-15 values) of three tuna species (n=4,281).
   After adjusting for regional variations in baseline N-15 values using a
   global ocean biogeochemistry model, generalized additive mixed models
   were employed to infer global-scale oceanographic controls of trophic
   structure, using cosmopolitan tuna species as a model.
   ResultsMain conclusionsFor the three tuna species, variation in trophic
   position estimated using bulk N-15 values was largely explained by
   geographical location and the corresponding oxygen minimum layer depth.
   Tuna trophic positions declined in areas with reduced oxygen at depth.
   Food-chain length, as captured by maximum trophic position, was longer
   in areas of the western Pacific Ocean and shorter in the northern
   Atlantic and eastern Pacific Oceans. Trophic adaptability of the tuna
   predators, as indicated by intraspecific variability, was highest in the
   western and central Pacific Ocean and lowest in the northern Atlantic
   Ocean. Our analysis demonstrated that while tunas share similar
   functional trophic roles, deeper-foraging tuna species had higher
   trophic positions globally. The predictive capacity of environmental
   variables decreased at finer (regional) spatial scales.
   Our work suggests that habitat compression resulting from the predicted
   global expansion of oxygen minimum zones with ocean warming will impact
   the trophic structure of marine food webs and the corresponding foraging
   habits of marine predators. Spatial scale analyses highlighted the
   importance of representing differences in regional ecological dynamics
   in global-scale trophic and ecosystem models.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands and savannas are among the most degraded biomes in the world.
   These biomes face a diverse number of anthropogenic threats, and despite
   this scenario, little attention is given to their conservation and
   sustainable use. This meta-analysis aims to analyze the effect of
   anthropogenic activities on the abundance of native mammals in these
   grassy ecosystems. A systematic research in the literature was carried
   out in order to find studies that analyzed variations in abundance of
   mammals in response to an anthropogenic activity in any grassland,
   savanna or shrubland environment around the world. After filtering, 24
   studies were analyzed, generating 202 effect sizes for five
   anthropogenic factors: cropland activities (32 effect sizes - ES);
   cattle ranching (58 ES); fire (30 ES); shrub/woody encroachment (56 ES)
   and urbanization (26 ES). Analyzed papers included field data from all
   continents. In general, mammalian abundance is decreasing under
   anthropogenic disturbance, as shown by the general effect size. This
   result highlights the need for more intense conservation programs in
   grasslands and savannas, since its species are under threat. When
   comparing the different anthropogenic threats, only cropland activities
   affected mammals significantly, reducing their abundance. The estimate
   of the mean effect of cattle ranching, fire, shrub/woody encroachment
   and urbanization on abundance of mammals did not differ from zero.
   However, for cattle ranching, fire and shrub/woody encroachment the mean
   effects measured had large confidence intervals, indicating that these
   mean effects could not be estimated accurately. Cattle ranching, fire
   and shrub/woody encroachment effects on mammalian abundance probably
   depend on their intensity and on the environmental characteristics of
   each ecosystem, and therefore each case must be analyzed in an
   ecosystem-specific perspective. Urbanization did not affect mammals,
   although this anthropogenic activity was analyzed only in two ecosystems
   where these urban areas do not cover bigger areas. Considering global
   necessity of maintaining and even increasing food production, we suggest
   that the cropland activities, which were the greatest threat to the
   abundance of mammals, should be used in a land sparing perspective.
   Meanwhile, cattle ranching could be used in a land sharing perspective,
   provided that cattle density will be restricted to such levels that
   could also guarantee the conservation of native species. Further studies
   regarding other taxa are desirable to confirm this recommendation
   considering the overall grassland and savanna biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{1. At the global scale, vineyards are usually managed intensively to
   optimize wine production without considering possible negative impacts
   on biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES) such as high soil erosion
   rates, degradation of soil fertility or contamination of groundwater.
   Winegrowers regulate competition for water and nutrients between the
   vines and inter-row vegetation by tilling, mulching and/or herbicide
   application. Strategies for more sustainable viticulture recommend
   maintaining vegetation cover in inter-rows, however, there is a lack of
   knowledge as to what extent this less intensive inter-row management
   affects biodiversity and associated ES.
   2. We performed a hierarchical meta-analysis to quantify the effects of
   extensive vineyard inter-row vegetation management in comparison to more
   intensive management (like soil tillage or herbicide use) on
   biodiversity and ES from 74 studies covering four continents and 13
   wine-producing countries.
   3. Overall, extensive vegetation management increased above- and
   below-ground biodiversity and ecosystem service provision by 20\% in
   comparison to intensive management. Organic management together with
   management without herbicides showed a stronger positive effect on ES
   and biodiversity provision than inter-row soil tillage.
   4. Soil loss parameters showed the largest positive response to
   inter-row vegetation cover. The second highest positive response was
   observed for biodiversity variables, followed by carbon sequestration,
   pest control and soil fertility. We found no trade-off between grape
   yield and quality vs. biodiversity or other ES.}},

Title = {{Bias in meta-analyses using Hedges' d}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The type of metric and weighting method used in meta-analysis can create
   bias and alter coverage of confidence intervals when the estimated
   effect size and its weight are correlated. Here, we investigate bias
   associated with the common metric, Hedges' d, under conditions common in
   ecological meta-analyses. We simulated data from experiments, computed
   effect sizes and their variances, and performed meta-analyses applying
   three weighting schemes (inverse variance, sample size, and unweighted)
   for varying levels of effect size, within-study replication, number of
   studies in the meta-analysis, and among-study variance. Unweighted
   analyses, and those using weights based on sample size, were close to
   unbiased and yielded coverages close to the nominal level of 0.95. In
   contrast, the inverse-variance weighting scheme led to bias and low
   coverage, especially for meta-analyses based on studies with low
   replication. This bias arose because of a correlation between the
   estimated effect and its weight when using the inverse-variance method.
   In many cases, the sample size weighting scheme was most efficient, and,
   when not, the differences in efficiency among the three methods were
   relatively minor. Thus, if using Hedges' d, we recommend using weights
   based upon sample size that do not involve individual study estimates of
   the effect size.}},

Abstract = {{Species richness and total abundance are two of the most commonly used
   response measures in empirical studies of the effects of anthropogenic
   land-use on biodiversity, in spite of the fact that they are insensitive
   to changes in a range of community attributes. We evaluated the extent
   to which meta-analyses about the effects of forest land-use on
   ecological communities make use of gross species richness, diversity and
   abundance measures (hereafter low-informative measures) as opposed to
   more refined response variables conveying a higher degree of
   conservation-relevant information, e.g., by accounting for compositional
   or functional changes in the communities (high-informative measures).
   Nearly one-half of the 221 included meta-analyses were based solely on
   low-informative measures. The prevalence of low-informative measures was
   higher for meta-analyses belonging to studies encompassing a broad
   taxonomic scope and it has increased since 2002. Few differences were
   detected in the use of response measures among taxonomic groups,
   although there were indications that some better-known groups tended to
   be more often studied with high-informative measures. To provide
   guidance for future work, we synthesized the high-informative measures
   of biodiversity used in the reviewed studies. For better-informed
   meta-analyses, we encourage the use of more refined approaches to
   quantify impacts on communities in addition to species richness and
   total abundance measures. This may involve, for example, the use of beta
   diversity and functional diversity measures, as well as separate
   analyses for different ecological groups or conservation status

Abstract = {{Urbanization is a severe threat to global biodiversity, often leading to
   taxonomic and functional homogenization. However, current urban ecology
   research has focused mostly on urban birds and plants, limiting our
   ability to make generalizations about the drivers of urban biodiversity
   globally. To address this gap, we conducted a global meta-analysis of 87
   studies, including 180 bat species (Chiroptera) from urban areas in
   Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America. We aimed to (i)
   understand the importance of functional traits and phylogeny in driving
   changes in urban bat assemblages, and (ii) assess the capacity of traits
   for predicting which types of species are most sensitive to
   urbanization. Our results indicate that species-specific functional
   traits explain differences in the intensity of urban habitat use. Urban
   tolerance mainly occurred within the open and edge space foraging and
   trawling species as well as in bats with flexible roosting strategies.
   In addition, across bioregions and independent of phylogeny, urban
   tolerance correlated with higher aspect ratio, a trait enabling fast
   flight but less agile manoeuvres during aerial food acquisition.
   Predictive success varied between bioregions, between 43 and 83\%. Our
   analysis demonstrates that the local extinction of bat species in urban
   areas is non-random, trait-based and predictable, allowing urban
   landscape managers to tailor local conservation actions to particular
   types of species.}},

Abstract = {{Prey naivete is a failure to recognize novel predators and thought to
   cause exaggerated impacts of alien predators on native wildlife. Yet
   there is equivocal evidence in the literature for native prey naivete
   towards aliens. To address this, we conducted a meta-analysis of
   Australian mammal responses to native and alien predators. Australia has
   the world's worst record of extinction and declines of native mammals,
   largely owing to two alien predators introduced more than 150 years ago:
   the feral cat, Felis catus, and European red fox, Vulpes vulpes.
   Analysis of 94 responses to predator cues shows that Australian mammals
   consistently recognize alien foxes as a predation threat, possibly
   because of thousands of years of experience with another canid predator,
   the dingo, Canis lupus dingo. We also found recognition responses
   towards cats; however, in four of the seven studies available, these
   responses were of risk-taking behaviour rather than antipredator
   behaviour. Our results suggest that a simple failure to recognize alien
   predators is not behind the ongoing exaggerated impacts of alien
   predators in Australia. Instead, our results highlight an urgent need to
   better understand the appropriateness of antipredator responses in prey
   towards alien predators in order to understand native prey

Volume = {{72}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis predicts that behavior and
   physiology covary with life history. Evidence for such covariation is
   contradictory, possibly because systematic sources of variation (e.g.
   sex) have been neglected. Sexes often experience different selection
   pressures leading to sex-specific allocation between reproduction and
   self-maintenance, facilitating divergence in life-history. Sex-specific
   differences in means and possibly variances may therefore play a key
   role in the POLS framework. We investigate whether sexes differ in means
   and variances along the fast-slow pace-of-life continuum for life
   history and physiological and behavioral traits. In addition, we test
   whether social and environmental characteristics such as breeding
   strategy, mating system, and study environment explain heterogeneity
   between the sexes. Using meta-analytic methods, we found that
   populations with a polygynous mating system or for studies conducted on
   wild populations, males had a faster pace-of-life for developmental
   life-history traits (e.g., growth rate), behavior, and physiology. In
   contrast, adult life-history traits (e.g., lifespan) were shifted
   towards faster pace-of-life in females, deviating from the other trait
   categories. Phenotypic variances were similar between the sexes across
   trait categories and were not affected by mating system or study
   environment. Breeding strategy did not influence sex differences in
   variances or means. We discuss our results in the light of sex-specific
   selection that might drive sex-specific differences in pace-of-life and
   ultimately POLS.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how marine organisms will be affected by global change is
   of primary importance to ensure ecosystem functioning and nature
   contributions to people. This study meets the call for addressing how
   life-history traits mediate effects of ocean acidification on fish. We
   built a database of overall and trait-mediated responses of teleost fish
   to future CO2 levels by searching the scientific literature. Using a
   meta-analytical approach, we investigated the effects of projected CO2
   levels by IPCC for 2050-2070 and 2100 on fish eco-physiology and
   behavior from 320 contrasts on 42 species, stemming from polar to
   tropical regions. Moreover, since organisms may experience a mosaic of
   carbonate chemistry in coastal environments (e.g., in estuaries,
   upwelling zones and intertidal habitats), which may have higher pCO(2)
   values than open ocean waters, we assessed responses from additional 103
   contrasts on 21 fish species using pCO(2) levels well above IPCC
   projections. Under mid-century and end-of-century CO2 emission
   scenarios, we found multiple CO2-dose-dependent effects on
   calcification, resting metabolic rate, yolk, and behavioral
   performances, along with increased predation risk and decreased
   foraging, particularly for larvae. Importantly, many of the traits
   considered will not confer fish tolerance to elevated CO2 and
   far-reaching ecological consequences on fish population replenishment
   and community structure will likely occur. Extreme CO2 levels well above
   IPCC projections showed effects on fish mortality and calcification,
   while growth, metabolism, and yolk were unaffected. CO2 exposures in
   short-term experiments increased fish mortality, which in turn decreased
   in longer-term exposures. Whatever the elevated CO2 levels considered,
   some key biological processes (e.g., reproduction, development, habitat
   choice) were critically understudied. Fish are an important resource for
   livelihoods in coastal communities and a key component for stability of
   marine ecosystems. Given the multiple trait-mediated effects evidenced
   here, we stress the need to fill the knowledge gap on important
   eco-physiological processes and to expand the number and duration of
   ocean acidification studies to multi-generational, multiple stressor
   (e.g., warming, hypoxia, fishing), and species interactions experiments
   to better elucidate complex ecosystem-level changes and how these
   changes might alter provisioning of ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{The use of pesticides within agricultural ecosystems has led to wide
   concern regarding negative effects on the environment. One possible
   alternative is the use of predators of pest species that naturally occur
   within agricultural ecosystems. However, the mechanistic basis for how
   species can be manipulated in order to maximize pest control remains
   unclear. We carried out a meta-analysis of 51 studies that manipulated
   predator species richness in reference to suppression of herbivore prey
   to determine which components of predator diversity affect pest control.
   Overall, functional diversity (FD) based on predator's habitat domain,
   diet breadth and hunting strategy was ranked as the most important
   variable. Our analysis showed that increases in FD in polycultures led
   to greater prey suppression compared to both the mean of the component
   predator species, and the most effective predator species, in
   monocultures. Further analysis of individual traits indicated these
   effects are likely to be driven by broad niche differentiation and
   greater resource exploitation in functionally diverse predator
   communities. A decoupled measure of phylogenetic diversity, whereby the
   overlap in variation with FD was removed, was not found to be an
   important driver of prey suppression. Our results suggest that
   increasing FD in predatory invertebrates will help maximize pest control
   ecosystem services in agricultural ecosystems, with the potential to
   increase suppression above that of the most effective predator species.}},

Abstract = {{The recently introduced concept of `landscape services'-ecosystem
   services influenced by landscape patterns-may be particularly useful in
   landscape planning by potentially increasing stakeholder participation
   and financial funding. However, integrating this concept remains
   challenging. In order to bypass this barrier, we must gain a greater
   understanding of how landscape composition and configuration influence
   the services provided.
   We conducted meta-analyses that considered published studies evaluating
   the effects of several landscape metrics on the following services:
   pollination, pest control, water quality, disease control, and aesthetic
   value. We report the cumulative mean effect size (E++), where the signal
   of the values is related to positive or negative influences.
   Landscape complexity differentially influenced the provision of
   services. Particularly, the percentage of natural areas had an effect on
   natural enemies (E++ = 0.35), pollination (E++ = 0.41), and disease
   control (E++ = 0.20), while the percentage of no-crop areas had an
   effect on water quality (E++ = 0.42) and pest response (E++ = 0.33).
   Furthermore, heterogeneity had an effect on aesthetic value (E++ = 0.5)
   and water quality (E++ = - 0.40). Moreover, landscape aggregation was
   important to explaining pollination (E++ = 0.29) and water quality (E++
   = 0.35).
   The meta-analyses reinforce the importance of considering landscape
   structure in assessing ecosystem services for management purposes and
   decision-making. The magnitude of landscape effect varies according to
   the service being studied. Therefore, land managers must account for
   landscape composition and configuration in order to ensure the
   maintenance of services and adapt their approach to suit the focal
   service.}},

   Google Scholar and included studies that provide data on the habitat
   requirements of cavity-nesting birds in temperate and boreal forests of
   varying naturalness. To compare nest and non-nest-tree characteristics,
   the following data were collected from the literature: diameter at
   breast height (DBH) and its standard deviation (SD), sample size of
   trees with and without active nest, amount of nest and available trees
   described as dead or with a broken crown, and amount of nest and
   available trees that were lacking these characteristics. Further
   collected data included bird species nesting in the cavities and
   nest-building type (nonexcavator/excavator), forest type
   (coniferous/deciduous/mixed), biome (temperate/boreal), and naturalness
   (managed/natural). From these data, three effect sizes were calculated
   that describe potential nest trees in terms of DBH, vital status
   (dead/alive), and crown status (broken/intact). These tree
   characteristics can be easily recognized by foresters. The results show
   that on average large-diameter trees, dead trees, and trees with broken
   crowns were selected for nesting. The magnitude of this effect varied
   depending primarily on bird species and the explanatory variables forest
   type and naturalness. Biome had lowest influence (indicated by AIC). We
   conclude that diameter at breast height, vitality, and crown status can

Abstract = {{Monetary valuation of dryland ecosystem services may help to increase

   comprehensive assessment of the indicators that determine the estimated

   66 valuation studies in drylands worldwide, this study analyzes the
   relative importance of local socio-economic, environmental and

   that monetary valuation outcomes are largely determined by the selected

Title = {{A case study and a meta-analysis of seasonal variation in fish mercury
   concentrations}},

Abstract = {{Mercury contamination in aquatic ecosystems is a concern due to health
   risks of consuming fish. Fish mercury concentrations are highly variable
   and influenced by a range of environmental factors. However, seasonal
   variation in mercury levels are typically overlooked when monitoring
   fish mercury concentrations, establishing consumption advisories, or
   creating accumulation models. Temporal variation in sampling could bias
   mercury concentration estimates of accumulation potential. Thus, the
   objectives of this study were to first evaluate seasonal variation of
   largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) axial muscle mercury
   concentration from two Iowa, USA impoundments. Second, we conducted a
   meta-analysis to evaluate if seasonal variation in mercury concentration
   is dependent upon mean mercury concentration, waterbody type, or fish
   trophic level or mean length. Largemouth bass were collected four times
   between May and October (24-36 fish per month) from Twelve Mile (2013)
   and Red Haw (2014) lakes. Largemouth bass axial muscle mercury
   concentrations were variable within and between lakes, ranging from
   undetectable ( < 0.05 mg/kg) to 0.54 mg/kg. Largemouth bass mercury
   concentrations were similar across months in Twelve Mile but varied
   temporally in Red Haw and were highest in July, intermediate in May and
   September, and lowest during October. Results of the meta-analysis
   suggest that seasonal variation in mercury concentrations is more likely
   to occur as mean mercury concentration of the population increases but
   is unrelated to waterbody type, trophic status, and fish size.
   Understanding seasonal variation in fish mercury concentrations will aid
   in the development of standardized sampling programs for long-term
   monitoring programs and fish consumption advisories.}},

Abstract = {{Over half a century of governing efforts have failed to prevent the
   depletion of fish stocks around the globe. Ineffective management of
   over-exploited resources has resulted in a lack of willingness to comply
   with regulatory systems, magnifying problems at a time when many of the
   world's fisheries face increasing pressure or crisis. Co-management, the
   sharing of management responsibilities between government, fishermen's
   organisations and other stakeholders, has been advocated as the solution
   to engaging stakeholders. However, an evidence base is required to
   assess whether co-management improves the sustainability of fisheries.
   Here, we used qualitative and, for the first time, quantitative
   meta-analyses to assess the outcomes of local fisheries co-management
   schemes around the globe, by asking (1) Does co-management improve the
   socioeconomic and biological factors underpinning fisheries, and (2) How
   do the characteristics of the most successful co-management structures
   compare to less successful structures? Data from multiple studies was
   extracted and measured against performance criteria through
   meta-analysis, assessing process (compliance, control, conflict,
   influence and participation) and outcome indicators (household income,
   access to resource, fish yield and resource well-being). Our results
   showed that co-management had an overall positive influence on all but
   one of the process indicators (conflict; no significant effect), but a
   negative influence on access to resource and resource well-being. Case
   studies that reported positive outcomes in general possessed attributes
   such as government support, funding and dedicated project staff,
   indicating certain prerequisites are required to establish a successful
   co-management scheme, though data limitations restrict our ability to
   draw more general conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Payments for environmental services (PES) programmes have been widely

   Improving the livelihoods of environmental services (ES) suppliers is
   not only seen as a side benefit but is often considered a prerequisite

   meta-analysis of causal statistical studies on the effects of PES on the
   livelihoods of ES suppliers in the developing world. The set-up of our
   meta-analysis allows us to draw more conservative but more reliable and
   generalisable overview lessons. Our findings suggest that PES programmes
   are likely to have positive but modest livelihood impacts on ES
   suppliers. Further, several institutional characteristics of PES are
   found to be correlated with more favourable livelihood impacts, such as
   high payments, high degree of voluntary participation, low transaction
   costs and better access to alternative income sources. Lastly, our

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Understanding how plant diversity influences higher trophic levels is
   important for predicting the consequences of global biodiversity loss.
   While early studies have focused on the effects of plant species
   richness, more recently a growing number of experiments have explored
   the effects of plant intraspecific diversity by manipulating the
   genotypic richness of plant communities.
   2. By combining 162 estimates of effect size from 60 experimental
   studies, we examined the effects of plant genotypic richness on
   arthropods, one of the most diverse and abundant taxa which play a
   crucial role in many ecosystem processes and services. We have also
   compared the effects of plant genetic and species diversity on
   arthropods when both were manipulated within the same study.
   3. Species richness and abundance of most trophic groups of arthropods
   were higher in genetically diverse plant stands. Interestingly, the
   effects of plant genetic diversity on natural enemies of herbivores were
   stronger than the effects of plant genetic diversity on herbivores,
   suggesting that plant genetic diversity effects on predators might be
   driven by mechanisms independent of herbivores.
   4. Herbivore and predator abundance increased with plant genetic
   diversity in studies using wild plants whereas predator abundance was
   unaffected and herbivore abundance was reduced by crop genetic
   diversity. Damage by generalist herbivores was reduced by plant genetic
   diversity whereas damage by specialist herbivores was not affected.
   5. When the effects of plant genetic and species diversity on arthropods
   were compared within the same study, the magnitude of plant genetic
   diversity effects was comparable to that of plant species diversity.
   6. Our results suggest that plant genetic diversity has significant
   effects on the diversity of arthropods across several trophic levels,
   thus highlighting the importance of maintaining high levels of both
   plant species and genetic diversity for arthropod conservation. However,
   the potential of using crop genetic mixtures in agriculture for pest
   control appears to be limited as even though herbivore abundance was
   reduced in genetically diverse plots, herbivore damage and predator
   abundance were not affected by crop genotypic richness.}},

Abstract = {{The aquatic environment is increasingly bombarded by a wide variety of
   noise pollutants whose range and intensity are increasing with each
   passing decade. Yet, little is known about how aquatic noise affects
   marine communities. To determine the implications that changes to the
   soundscape may have on fishes, a meta-analysis was conducted focusing on
   the ramifications of noise on fish behavior and physiology. Our
   meta-analysis identified 42 studies that produced 2,354 data points,
   which in turn indicated that anthropogenic noise negatively affects fish
   behavior and physiology. The most predominate responses occurred within
   foraging ability, predation risk, and reproductive success.
   Additionally, anthropogenic noise was shown to increase the hearing
   thresholds and cortisol levels of numerous species while tones,
   biological, and environmental noise were most likely to affect complex
   movements and swimming abilities. These findings suggest that the
   majority of fish species are sensitive to changes in the aquatic
   soundscape, and depending on the noise source, species responses may
   have extreme and negative fitness consequences. As such, this global

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Forest and Spotted Owl management documents often state that severe
   wildfire is a cause of recent declines in populations of Spotted Owls
   and that mixed-severity fires (5-70\% of burned area in high severity
   patches with >75\% mortality of dominant vegetation) pose a primary
   threat to Spotted Owl population viability. This systematic review and
   meta-analysis summarize all available scientific literature on the
   effects of wildfire on Spotted Owl demography and ecology from studies
   using empirical data to answer the question: How does fire, especially
   recent mixed-severity fires with representative patches of high-severity
   burn within their home ranges, affect Spotted Owl foraging habitat
   selection, demography, and site occupancy parameters? Fifteen papers
   reported 50 effects from fire that could be differentiated from
   post-fire logging. Meta-analysis of mean standardized effects (I ledge's
   d) found only one parameter was significantly different from zero, a
   significant positive foraging habitat selection for low-severity burned
   forest. Multi-level mixed effects meta-regressions (hierarchical models)
   of I ledge's d against percent of study area burned at high severity and
   time since fire found the following: a negative correlation of occupancy
   with time since fire; a positive effect on recruitment immediately after
   the fire, with the effect diminishing with time since fire; reproduction
   was positively correlated with the percent of high-severity fire in owl
   territories; and positive selection for foraging in low- and
   moderate-severity burned forest, with high-severity burned forest used
   in proportion to its availability, but not avoided. Meta-analysis of
   variation found significantly greater variation in parameters from
   burned sites relative to unburned, with specifically higher variation in
   estimates of occupancy demography, and survival, and lower variation in
   estimates of selection probability for foraging habitat in low-severity
   burned forest. Spotted Owls were usually not significantly affected by
   mixed-severity fire, as 83\% of all studies and 60\% of all effects
   found no significant impact of fire on mean owl parameters. Contrary to
   current perceptions and recovery efforts for the Spotted Owl,
   mixed-severity fire does not appear to be a serious threat to owl
   populations; rather, wildfire has arguably more benefits than costs for
   Spotted Owls.}},

Abstract = {{Neonicotinoid insecticides are currently the fastest-growing and most
   widely used insecticide class worldwide. Valued for their versatility in
   application, these insecticides may cause deleterious effects in a range
   of non-target (beneficial) arthropods. However, it remains unclear
   whether strong patterns exist in terms of their major effects, if broad
   measures of arthropod performance are negatively affected, or whether
   different functional groups are equally vulnerable. Here, we present a
   meta-analysis of 372 observations from 44 field and laboratory studies
   that describe neonicotinoid effects on 14 arthropod orders across five
   broad performance measures: abundance, behavior, condition, reproductive
   success, and survival. Across studies, neonicotinoids negatively
   affected all performance metrics evaluated; however, magnitude of the
   effects varied. Arthropod behavior and survival were the most negatively
   affected and abundance was the least negatively affected. Effects on
   arthropod functional groups were inconsistent. Pollinator condition,
   reproductive success, and survival were significantly lower in
   neonicotinoid treatments compared to untreated controls; whereas,
   neonicotinoid effects on detritivores were not significant. Although
   magnitude of arthropod response to neonicotinoids varied among

   variation of the consolidated EOSL biomass along the coast of China
   exhibited an erratic ``W{''}-shape and fell within the range of

   Additionally, the EOSL biomass was not correlated with climatic factors,

Abstract = {{Understanding the distribution of crossovers along chromosomes is
   crucial to evolutionary genomics because the crossover rate determines
   how strongly a genome region is influenced by natural selection on
   linked sites. Nevertheless, generalities in the chromosome-scale
   distribution of crossovers have not been investigated formally. We fill
   this gap by synthesizing joint information on genetic and physical maps
   across 62 animal, plant and fungal species. Our quantitative analysis
   reveals a strong and taxonomically widespread reduction of the crossover
   rate in the centre of chromosomes relative to their peripheries. We
   demonstrate that this pattern is poorly explained by the position of the
   centromere, but find that the magnitude of the relative reduction in the
   crossover rate in chromosome centres increases with chromosome length.
   That is, long chromosomes often display a dramatically low crossover
   rate in their centre, whereas short chromosomes exhibit a relatively
   homogeneous crossover rate. This observation is compatible with a model
   in which crossover is initiated from the chromosome tips, an idea with
   preliminary support from mechanistic investigations of meiotic
   recombination. Consequently, we show that organisms achieve a higher
   genome-wide crossover rate by evolving smaller chromosomes. Summarizing
   theory and providing empirical examples, we finally highlight that
   taxonomically widespread and systematic heterogeneity in crossover rate
   along chromosomes generates predictable broad-scale trends in genetic
   diversity and population differentiation by modifying the impact of
   natural selection among regions within a genome. We conclude by
   emphasizing that chromosome-scale heterogeneity in crossover rate should
   urgently be incorporated into analytical tools in evolutionary genomics,
   and in the interpretation of resulting patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Most of our knowledge of the effect of grazing on grassland structure is
   based on grazed-ungrazed contrasts. The effects of grazing in the most
   common scenario, where grazing intensity varies from low to high grazing
   intensity, are less known. The objectives of this paper were to 1)
   quantify the effect of stocking rates on species richness and diversity
   of grasslands world-wide, and 2) evaluate the response under different
   environmental and experimental conditions. We conducted a meta-analysis
   of experiments with at least two levels of controlled stocking rates and
   evaluated their effect on species richness and diversity. The results
   showed that the response of richness and diversity to either reducing or
   increasing stocking rate from a moderate level mostly fell within the
   range 25\% or 5 species. Mean response of species richness and diversity
   to increasing stocking rate from moderate to high levels was negative.
   Mean response to lowering stocking rate from moderate levels was not
   different from zero. However, overall, species richness significantly
   decreased as stocking rate increased. The response of richness and
   diversity to stocking rate was not related to mean precipitation,
   productivity or aridity. However, the most negative responses of
   richness to stocking rate were larger in arid, low productivity systems
   than in subhumid and humid systems. The effects of grazing on richness
   and diversity found in this review were smaller than the effects on
   species composition shown by the literature. Thus, grazing drastically
   changes species composition, but the net change of species and diversity
   is much smaller.}},

Title = {{Water regulation by grasslands: A global meta-analysis}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Grasslands have been modified and replaced worldwide and have affected
   water regulation ecosystem services. In order to support public policies
   attending to the consequences of different grassland modifications and
   replacements, general patterns and models about their consequences on
   water regulation are needed. We quantitatively meta-analysed the results
   of 110 site-specific studies analysing infiltration (83) and
   evapotranspiration (28) responses to grasslands alterations by grazing,
   crops, and afforestation and how these responses vary with environmental
   factors. In grasslands, soil water infiltration is significantly reduced
   by grazing and cropping on average by 51\% and 57\%, respectively. Water
   infiltration is increased by 65\% in response to afforestation. The
   reduction of infiltration with grazing decreases with soil sand content
   and increases with the mean annual precipitation (PPT) and the ratio
   PPT/mean annual potential evapotranspiration. The replacement of
   grasslands by forests increases evapotranspiration by 30\%, and the
   variation of this response was linearly related to PPT and the PPT/mean
   annual potential evapotranspiration ratio. There was a negative trend in
   evapotranspiration responses although not significant, when grasslands
   were replaced by crops or modified by grazing. Our meta-analysis was
   able to reveal average patterns and the influence of local climate and
   soil properties on eco-hydrological responses to grasslands
   modifications and replacements, which have not been previously
   described. These results may support general predictive models on the
   influence of land use changes and ecosystem services provision.
   Significant gaps were found in the number of studies, especially of
   evapotranspiration, precluding the achievement of a general conclusion
   regarding evapotranspiration and infiltration responses.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a comprehensive review of the literature on the
   economic values for ecosystem goods and services in Mexico. We analyzed
   106 studies that estimated an economic value for any given environmental
   good or service in the country. In total, we coded and classified 352
   values according to the Common International Classification of Ecosystem
   Services (CICES) and the Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB)
   ecosystem classification. We then estimated an econometric model to
   compare the value of different services in different ecosystems. We show
   that regulation services are more valuable than cultural and
   provisioning services, that wetlands are more valuable than forests and
   cultivated systems, and that deforestation for arable land is not
   cost-effective, because the regulation services of forests are more
   valuable than the provisioning services of crops. We also calculate the
   elasticity between the value of ecosystem services that forests provide
   in Mexico (in USD/hectare per year) and the supply of each ecosystem (in
   hectares). This elasticity is statistically significant and equal to
   -0.37. This estimate is relevant in policy terms, since it adds an
   economic rationale for conservation to other moral and philosophical
   criteria, especially in areas currently experiencing a high degree of

Abstract = {{Mangroves harbor diverse invertebrate communities, suggesting that
   macroecological distribution patterns of habitat-forming foundation
   species drive the associated faunal distribution. Whether these are
   driven by mangrove biogeography is still ambiguous. For small-bodied
   taxa, local factors and landscape metrics might be as important as
   macroecology. We performed a meta-analysis to address the following
   questions: (1) can richness of mangrove trees explain macroecological
   patterns of nematode richness? and (2) do local landscape attributes
   have equal or higher importance than biogeography in structuring
   nematode richness? Mangrove areas of Caribbean-Southwest Atlantic,
   Western Indian, Central Indo-Pacific, and Southwest Pacific
   biogeographic regions. We used random-effects meta-analyses based on
   natural logarithm of the response ratio (lnRR) to assess the importance
   of macroecology (i.e., biogeographic regions, latitude, longitude),
   local factors (i.e., aboveground mangrove biomass and tree richness),
   and landscape metrics (forest area and shape) in structuring nematode
   richness from 34 mangroves sites around the world. Latitude, mangrove
   forest area, and forest shape index explained 19\% of the heterogeneity
   across studies. Richness was higher at low latitudes, closer to the
   equator. At local scales, richness increased slightly with landscape
   complexity and decreased with forest shape index. Our results contrast
   with biogeographic diversity patterns of mangrove-associated taxa.
   Global-scale nematode diversity may have evolved independently of
   mangrove tree richness, and diversity of small-bodied metazoans is
   probably more closely driven by latitude and associated climates, rather
   than local, landscape, or global biogeographic patterns.}},

   found that results were driven by several key features of the CGE
   studies included in our database. We investigated features such as
   biofuel type, geographic area, and characteristics of the CGE models
   employed. We found that biofuel expansion has heterogeneous effects in
   developed versus emerging countries. Simulations on longer time periods
   and in multi-country studies led to results that indicate higher impacts

   simulations with an increase in agricultural productivity indicate

Abstract = {{1. The use of biologging devices continues to increase with
   technological advances yielding remarkable ecological insights and
   generating new research questions. However, as devices develop and are
   deployed more widely, there is a need to update our knowledge of the
   potential ethical impacts to allow scientists to balance these against
   the knowledge gained.
   2. We employed a suite of phylogenetically controlled meta-analyses on a
   dataset comprising more than 450 published effect sizes across 214
   different studies to examine the effects of biologger tagging on five
   key traits in birds.
   3. Overall, we found small but significant negative effects of tagging
   on survival, reproduction, parental care. In addition, tagging was
   positively associated with foraging trip duration, but had no effect on
   body mass. Meta-regressions revealed that flying style, migration
   distance and proportional tag mass were significant influences producing
   these deleterious effects, with attachment type and position
   additionally important covariates influencing survival-and
   reproduction-based effect sizes.
   4. There was a positive correlation between the effects of tagging on
   survival and reproduction, highlighting that effects may be cumulative,
   with the full effects of tagging not necessarily apparent in studies
   focused on single traits. We discuss the tradeoff between these negative
   effects and the advances gained through the use of biologgers.
   5. Finally, given the number of studies from our initial literature
   search that lacked sufficient data for inclusion in analyses, we provide
   recommendations on the essential information that all biologging studies

Abstract = {{Variation in climate has been demonstrated to be a powerful driver of
   selection and local adaptation among plant populations. Variation in
   functional traits among populations can also be indicative of the
   drivers of local adaptation. However, it is not clear to what extent
   species exhibit consistent patterns of local adaptation as revealed by
   common, heritable trait-environment relationships among populations. To
   address this, we conducted a meta-analysis of common garden studies of
   grass populations to quantify the degree of heritability of several
   commonly measured functional traits, and whether demonstrated
   heritability was driven by climate. We found that leaf size, specific
   leaf area (SLA) and total biomass all displayed strong broad-sense of
   heritability. Both leaf area and SLA decreased significantly with
   increasing temperature seasonality among populations within species,
   while total biomass increased with increasing annual and dry season
   precipitation, and decreased with increasing precipitation seasonality.
   These results indicate similar, consistent drivers of local adaptation
   among species of grasses. Further information on trait-environment
   relationships within species could greatly improve our ability to
   predict broad scale patterns in functional diversity across multiple
   levels of ecological organization. Expanding the range of traits and
   regions incorporated in common garden research, in the present case by
   incorporating root traits and Southern Hemisphere taxa, will provide
   even greater benefits to the fields of restoration, conservation, and
   global change ecology.}},

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{256}},
Pages = {{61-73}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Assessments of environmental drivers that regulate the functional
   composition of various organisms have become more frequent in the
   ecological literature, as this approach establishes a more direct
   connection between community structure and ecosystem functions. Bee
   response traits, such as sociality, body size, nest location, nest
   behaviour, and dietary specialization, have been reported in empirical
   studies that examine the role of land use intensity in functional
   diversity. However, empirical studies include different descriptors
   measured at different spatial scales, producing poor generalizations.
   Processes operating at different scales may have different effects
   depending on the response traits considered in the analysis. In this
   meta-analysis, we provide a quantitative assessment of the role that the
   structural complexity of habitats at local and landscape scales plays in
   the richness and abundance patterns of bees, considering different
   response traits. As indicated through this meta analysis, the
   descriptors of structural complexity at the local scale explained more
   of the richness and abundance of bees with distinct response traits than
   the descriptors at the landscape scale. In addition, high management
   intensity has a negative effect on the different response traits.
   Below-ground nesting bees and social bees showed different abundance
   trends, which suggest a mechanism denominated `response diversity'. This
   result suggests that the adoption of hybrid management strategies at the
   local scale could support the richness and abundance of different bees
   with distinct response traits in agroecosystems. These distinct response
   traits can be an important ecological pattern that contributes to the
   development of management strategies that maintain, in space and time,
   bees with distinct response traits. However, we should analyse the
   communities in terms of clusters of response traits, considering the
   possible synergies and trade-offs between these traits.}},

Title = {{Paceless life? A meta-analysis of the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis predicts that individual
   differences in behavior should integrate with morphological,
   physiological, and life-history traits along a slow to fast pace-of-life
   continuum. For example, individuals with a ``slow{''} pace-of-life are
   expected to exhibit a slower growth rate, delayed reproduction, longer
   lifespans, have stronger immune responses, and are expected to avoid
   risky situations relative to ``fast{''} individuals. If supported, this
   hypothesis would help resolve ecological and evolutionary questions
   regarding the origin and maintenance of phenotypic variation. Support
   for the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis has, however, been mixed. Here,
   we conducted a meta-analysis of 42 articles and 179 estimates testing
   the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis as it applies to the integration of
   behaviors with physiological or life-history traits. We found little
   overall support for the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis with the mean
   support estimated as r = 0.06. Support for the pace-of-life syndrome
   hypothesis was significantly higher in invertebrates (r = 0.23) than
   vertebrates (r = 0.02) and significantly higher when based on phenotypic
   (r = 0.10) versus genetic correlations (r = -0.09). We also found that
   females exhibited correlations between behavior and life-history and
   physiology that were opposite the predictions of the pace-of-life
   syndrome hypothesis (r = -0.16) and that these correlations
   significantly differed from those observed in males (r = 0.01) or males
   and females pooled (r = 0.12). It was also the case that there was
   little support for the hypothesis when life-history and physiological
   traits were independently analyzed (behavior x life-history: r = 0.12;
   behavior x physiology: r = 0.04). Exploratory post hoc analyses revealed
   that correlations of behavior with growth rate and hormone levels were
   more likely to show support for the predictions of the pace-of-life
   syndrome hypothesis. The lack of overall support found in our analyses
   suggests that general assertions regarding phenotypic integration due to
   ``pace-of-life{''} should be re-evaluated.
   Significance statement
   The pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis has been proposed as an overall
   organizational framework for the integration of behavioral,
   life-history, and physiological traits. This hypothesis provides
   potentially profound insights into how and why phenotypic traits might
   covary and why phenotypic variation may be maintained within
   populations. Over the last 7 years, this organizational framework has
   been intensively investigated as it pertains to relationships between
   behavior and other traits. Here, we conducted an overall analysis of
   whether the hypothesis was supported. Despite considerable research
   investment across behavioral ecology, we did not find that available
   data supported the pace-of-life syndrome hypothesis. This suggests that
   either the hypothesis has been inappropriately tested or is not
   generally applicable.}},

Abstract = {{Ecologists have extensively investigated the effect of warming on
   consumer-resource interactions, with experiments revealing that warming
   can strengthen, weaken or have no net effect on top-down control of
   resources. These experiments have inspired a body of theoretical work to
   explain the variation in the effect of warming on top-down control.
   However, there has been no quantitative attempt to reconcile theory with
   outcomes from empirical studies. To address the gap between theory and
   experiment, we performed a meta-analysis to examine the combined effect
   of experimental warming and top-down control on resource biomass and
   determined potential sources of variation across experiments. We show
   that differences in experimental outcomes are related to systematic
   variation in the geographical distribution of studies. Specifically,
   warming strengthened top-down control when experiments were conducted in
   colder regions, but had the opposite effect in warmer regions.
   Furthermore, we found that differences in the thermoregulation strategy
   of the consumer and openness of experimental arenas to dispersal can
   contribute to some deviation from the overall geographical pattern.
   These results reconcile empirical findings and support the expectation
   of geographical variation in the response of consumer-resource
   interactions to warming.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive ecosystem engineers (IEE) are potentially one of the most
   influential types of biological invaders. They are expected to have
   extensive ecological impacts by altering the physical-chemical structure
   of ecosystems, thereby changing the rules of existence for a broad range
   of resident biota. To test the generality of this expectation, we used a
   global systematic review and meta-analysis to examine IEE effects on the
   abundance of individual species and communities, biodiversity (using
   several indices) and ecosystem functions, focusing on marine and
   estuarine environments. We found that IEE had a significant effect
   (positive and negative) in most studies testing impacts on individual
   species, but the overall (cumulative) effect size was small and
   negative. Many individual studies showed strong IEE effects on community
   abundance and diversity, but the direction of effects was variable,
   leading to statistically non-significant overall effects in most
   categories. In contrast, there was a strong overall effect on most
   ecosystem functions we examined. IEE negatively affected metabolic
   functions and primary production, but positively affected nutrient flux,
   sedimentation and decomposition. We use the results to develop a
   conceptual model by highlighting pathways whereby IEE impact communities
   and ecosystem functions, and identify several sources of research bias
   in the IEE-related invasion literature. Only a few of the studies
   simultaneously quantified IEE effects on community/diversity and
   ecosystem functions. Therefore, understanding how IEE may alter
   biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships should be a primary focus
   of future studies of invasion biology. Moreover, the clear effects of
   IEE on ecosystem functions detected in our study suggest that scientists
   and environmental managers ought to examine how the effects of IEE might
   be manifested in the services that marine ecosystems provide to humans.}},

   their error variance, in order to maximize precision. Unbiased
   variability in the estimates of these study-level error variances
   increases with the inverse of study-level replication. Here, we
   demonstrate how this variability accumulates asymmetrically across
   studies in precision-weighted meta-analysis, to cause undervaluation of
   the meta-level effect size or its error variance (the meta-effect and
   meta-variance). Small samples, typical of the ecological literature,
   induce big sampling errors in variance estimation, which substantially
   bias precision-weighted meta-analysis. Simulations revealed that biases
   differed little between random- and fixed-effects tests. Meta-estimation
   of a one-sample mean from 20 studies, with sample sizes of 3-20
   observations, undervalued the meta-variance by c.20\%. Meta-analysis of
   two-sample designs from 20 studies, with sample sizes of 3-10
   observations, undervalued the meta-variance by 15\%-20\% for the log
   response ratio (lnR); it undervalued the meta-effect by c.10\% for the
   standardized mean difference (SMD). For all estimators, biases were
   eliminated or reduced by a simple adjustment to the weighting on study
   precision. The study-specific component of error variance prone to
   sampling error and not parametrically attributable to study-specific
   replication was replaced by its cross-study mean, on the assumptions of
   random sampling from the same population variance for all studies, and
   sufficient studies for averaging. Weighting each study by the inverse of
   this mean-adjusted error variance universally improved accuracy in
   estimation of both the meta-effect and its significance, regardless of
   number of studies. For comparison, weighting only on sample size gave
   the same improvement in accuracy, but could not sensibly estimate
   significance. For the one-sample mean and two-sample lnR, adjusted
   weighting also improved estimation of between-study variance by
   DerSimonian-Laird and REML methods. For random-effects meta-analysis of
   SMD from little-replicated studies, the most accurate meta-estimates
   obtained from adjusted weights following conventionally weighted
   estimation of between-study variance. We recommend adoption of weighting
   by inverse adjusted-variance for meta-analyses of well- and
   little-replicated studies, because it improves accuracy and significance
   of meta-estimates, and it can extend the scope of the meta-analysis to
   include some studies without variance estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Vertebrate pollinators are increasingly threatened worldwide, but little
   is known about the potential consequences of declining pollinator
   populations on plants and ecosystems. Here, we present the first global
   assessment of the importance of vertebrate pollinators in the
   reproductive success of selected flowering plants. Our meta-analysis of
   126 experiments on animal-pollinated plants revealed that excluding
   vertebrate pollinators - but not insect pollinators - reduced fruit
   and/or seed production by 63\% on average. We found bat-pollinated
   plants to be more dependent on their respective vertebrate pollinators
   than bird-pollinated plants (an average 83\% reduction in fruit/seed
   production when bats were excluded, as compared to a 46\% reduction when
   birds were excluded). Plant dependence on vertebrate pollinators for
   fruit/seed production was greater in the tropics than at higher
   latitudes. Given the potential for substantial negative impacts
   associated with the loss of vertebrate pollinators, there is a clear

Abstract = {{Urbanization is one of the most extreme forms of environmental
   alteration, posing a major threat to biodiversity. We studied the
   effects of urbanization on avian communities via a systematic review
   using hierarchical and categorical meta-analyses. Altogether, we found
   42 observations from 37 case studies for species richness and 23
   observations from 20 case studies for abundance. Urbanization had an
   overall strong negative effect on bird species richness, whereas
   abundance increased marginally with urbanization. There was no evidence
   that city size played a role in influencing the relationship between
   urbanization and either species richness or abundance. Studies that
   examined long gradients (i.e. from urban to rural) were more likely to
   detect negative urbanization effects on species richness than studies
   that considered short gradients (i.e. urban vs. suburban or urban vs.
   rural areas). In contrast, we found little evidence that the effect of
   urbanization on abundance was influenced by gradient length. Effects of
   urbanization on species richness were more negative for studies
   including public green spaces (parks and other amenity areas) in the
   sampled landscapes. In contrast, studies performed solely in the urban
   matrix (i.e. no green spaces) revealed a strong positive effect on bird
   abundance. When performing subset analyses on urban-suburban,
   suburban-rural and suburban-natural comparisons, species richness
   decreased from natural to urban areas, but with a stronger decrease at
   the urban-suburban interface, whereas bird abundance showed a clear
   intermediate peak along the urban-rural gradient although abundance in
   natural areas was comparable to that in suburban areas. This suggests
   that species loss happens especially at the urban-suburban interface,
   and that the highest abundances occur in suburban areas compared to
   urban or rural areas. Thus, our study shows the importance of suburban
   areas, where the majority of birds occur with fairly high species
   richness.}},

Abstract = {{Sex allocation theory predicts that parents should bias offspring sex to
   maximize their fitness in a given context. Quantifying the fitness
   benefits of offspring sex-ratio biases would be facilitated by a better
   knowledge of their underlying mechanism(s) and associated costs. The
   hypothesis that steroid hormones are involved in sex determination has
   gained in popularity recently. Being influenced by external stimuli and
   involved in a range of physiological processes, they could be a
   ubiquitous mediator of environmental conditions influencing sex-ratio
   with low fitness costs. Previous studies indicated that higher maternal
   testosterone levels led to the overproduction of sons around conception
   in both birds and mammals. We conducted a systematic review (including
   meta-analysis) of these studies and, as predicted, we found a weak
   positive and significant overall effect of maternal testosterone on the
   proportion of sons. Neither taxa, nor the type of study
   (experimental/observational), or the timing of timing testosterone
   manipulation/measure were significant predictors of offspring sex-ratio,
   which may be explained by low statistical power in addition to low
   variability between effect sizes. Our meta-analysis provides evidence
   for a general positive influence of maternal testosterone around
   conception on the proportion of sons across birds and mammals, although
   less confidently so for the latter. It begs for more large-scale
   experimental studies, especially on mammals, and ideally in the wild. It
   may also have some important consequences for the poultry industry.}},

Title = {{Habitat restoration benefits wild bees: A meta-analysis}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Pollinator conservation is of increasing interest in the light of
   managed honeybee (Apis mellifera) declines, and declines in some species
   of wild bees. Much work has gone into understanding the effects of
   habitat enhancements in agricultural systems on wild bee abundance,
   richness and pollination services. However, the effects of ecological
   restoration targeting ``natural{''} ecological endpoints (e.g. restoring
   former agricultural fields to historic vegetation types or improving
   degraded natural lands) on wild bees have received relatively little
   attention, despite their potential importance for countering habitat
   loss.
   2. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of ecological
   restoration on wild bee abundance and richness, focusing on unmanaged
   bee communities in lands restored and managed to increase habitat
   availability and quality. Specifically, we assessed bee abundance and/or
   richness across studies comparing restored vs. unrestored treatments and
   studies investigating effects of specific habitat restoration
   techniques, such as burning, grazing, invasive plant removal and
   seeding.
   3. We analysed 28 studies that met our selection criteria: these
   represented 11 habitat types and 7 restoration techniques. Nearly all
   restorations associated with these studies were performed without
   explicit consideration of habitat needs for bees or other pollinators.
   The majority of restorations targeted plant community goals, which could
   potentially have ancillary benefits for bees.
   4. Restoration had overall positive effects on wild bee abundance and
   richness across multiple habitat types. Specific restoration actions,
   tested independently, also tended to have positive effects on wild bee
   richness and abundance.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We found strong evidence that ecological
   restoration advances wild bee conservation. This is important given that
   habitat loss is recognized as a leading factor in pollinator decline.
   Pollinator responses to land management are rarely evaluated in
   non-agricultural settings and so support for wild bees may be an
   underappreciated benefit of botanically focused management. Future
   restoration projects that explicitly consider the needs of wild bees
   could be more effective at providing nesting, foraging and other habitat
   resources. We encourage land managers to design and evaluate restoration
   projects with the habitat needs of wild bee species in mind.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Across the planet, grass-dominated biomes are experiencing shrub
   encroachment driven by atmospheric CO2 enrichment and land-use change.
   By altering resource structure and availability, shrub encroachment may
   have important impacts on vertebrate communities. We sought to determine
   the magnitude and variability of these effects across climatic
   gradients, continents, and taxa, and to learn whether shrub thinning
   restores the structure of vertebrate communities.
   Location: Worldwide.
   Time period: Contemporary.
   Major taxa studied: Terrestrial vertebrates.
   Methods: We estimated relationships between percentage shrub cover and
   the structure of terrestrial vertebrate communities (species richness,
   Shannon diversity and community abundance) in experimentally thinned and
   unmanipulated shrub-encroached grass-dominated biomes using systematic
   review and meta-analyses of 43 studies published from 1978 to 2016. We
   modelled the effects of continent, biome, mean annual precipitation, net
   primary productivity and the normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) on the relationship between shrub cover and vertebrate community
   structure.
   Results: Species richness, Shannon diversity and total abundance had no
   consistent relationship with shrub encroachment and experimental
   thinning did not reverse encroachment effects on vertebrate communities.
   However, some effects of shrub encroachment on vertebrate communities
   differed with net primary productivity, amongst vertebrate groups, and
   across continents. Encroachment had negative effects on vertebrate
   diversity at low net primary productivity. Mammalian and herpetofaunal
   diversity decreased with shrub encroachment. Shrub encroachment also had
   negative effects on species richness and total abundance in Africa but
   positive effects in North America.
   Main conclusions: Biodiversity conservation and mitigation efforts
   responding to shrub encroachment should focus on low-productivity
   locations, on mammals and herpetofauna, and in Africa. However, targeted
   research in neglected regions such as central Asia and India will be
   needed to fill important gaps in our knowledge of shrub encroachment
   effects on vertebrates. Additionally, our findings provide an impetus
   for determining the mechanisms associated with changes in vertebrate
   diversity and abundance in shrub-encroached grass-dominated biomes.}},

   ease P limitation and decouple the biogeochemical cycling of P, carbon

Abstract = {{Individual differences in behaviour characterize humans and animals
   alike. A hot field in behavioural ecology asks why this variation in

   energetic reserves and structural size have particularly been proposed
   as states covarying with behaviour among-individuals, either genetically

   estimating the amount of among-individual variation in behaviour
   attributable to variation in state. Our literature search showed that
   only 22\% of the studies claiming to estimate individual-level
   associations between state and behaviour actually did so. Our

   and/or active individuals had relatively high metabolic rates, hormone
   levels, body weights and/or body sizes. The proportion of
   among-individual variation common to state and behaviour was

   explanations involving intrinsic states fail to explain much individual
   variation in behaviour, (ii) empiricists should consider nonlinear,
   additive or interactive effects of (multiple) intrinsic states, (iii)
   explanations not involving intrinsic states might be important, or (iv)

Abstract = {{Organic farming has become a major agricultural and economic sector, and
   weed management is one of the primary challenges facing the industry. Of
   particular concern are rhizomatous perennial weeds such as field
   bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.) and Canada thistle {[}Cirsium arvense
   (L.) Scop.] which are highly competitive and not easily controlled in
   organic systems. We conducted meta-analyses of the existing literature
   to 1) identify promising management approaches for these weeds in the
   absence of synthetic herbicides and 2) determine which aspects of field
   bindweed and Canada thistle management warrant further study. Mechanical
   control (i.e. plowing, cultivation, hoeing) was the most studied
   management category in annual cropping systems, accounting for 40\% of
   data extracted, but did not outperform most of the other management
   actions overall, possibly due to the variability in specific methodology
   (i.e. timing, frequency, depth, implement). In annual systems,
   integrated management, or the combination of two or more control
   methods, emerged as the management technique that caused the greatest
   decrease in abundance and survival for field bindweed. We identified
   several additional management techniques that decreased field bindweed
   and/or Canada thistle in both annual and perennial systems including
   biocontrol, mowing, grazing, crop diversification, solarization,
   shading, flaming, and crop competition. However, organic producers
   continue to struggle with these species. This discrepancy may originate
   from the fact that most of the studies we evaluated reported impacts
   over short time spans, with 53\% being Conducted for a period of one to
   two years, and only 9\% conducted for five or more years. Further, only
   16\% of field bindweed and 26\% of Canada thistle studies reported
   measures of variability. Longer term research focused on sustainable
   perennial weed management systems is needed in addition to research
   about short-term interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated nitrogen (N) deposition may increase net primary productivity
   in N-limited terrestrial ecosystems and thus enhance the terrestrial
   carbon (C) sink. To assess the magnitude of this N-induced C sink, we
   performed a meta-analysis on data from forest fertilization experiments
   to estimate N-induced C sequestration in aboveground tree woody biomass,
   a stable C pool with long turnover times. Our results show that boreal
   and temperate forests responded strongly to N addition and sequestered
   on average an additional 14 and 13kg C per kg N in aboveground woody
   biomass, respectively. Tropical forests, however, did not respond
   significantly to N addition. The common hypothesis that tropical forests
   do not respond to N because they are phosphorus-limited could not be
   confirmed, as we found no significant response to phosphorus addition in
   tropical forests. Across climate zones, we found that young forests
   responded more strongly to N addition, which is important as many
   previous meta-analyses of N addition experiments rely heavily on data
   from experiments on seedlings and young trees. Furthermore, the C-N
   response (defined as additional mass unit of C sequestered per
   additional mass unit of N addition) was affected by forest productivity,
   experimental N addition rate, and rate of ambient N deposition. The
   estimated C-N responses from our meta-analysis were generally lower that
   those derived with stoichiometric scaling, dynamic global vegetation
   models, and forest growth inventories along N deposition gradients. We
   estimated N-induced global C sequestration in tree aboveground woody
   biomass by multiplying the C-N responses obtained from the meta-analysis
   with N deposition estimates per biome. We thus derived an N-induced
   global C sink of about 177 (112-243) Tg C/year in aboveground and
   belowground woody biomass, which would account for about 12\% of the
   forest biomass C sink (1,400 Tg C/year).}},

   environmental benefits, a form of environmental injustice. The evidence
   of this problem is not uniform however, and evidence of inequity varies
   in size and significance across studies. This variation in results
   suggests the need for a research synthesis and meta-analysis.
   We employed a systematic literature search to identify original studies
   which examined the relationship between urban forest cover and income (n
   = 61) and coded each effect size (n = 332). We used meta-analytic
   techniques to estimate the average (unconditional) relationship between
   urban forest cover and income and to estimate the impact that
   methodological choices, measurement, publication characteristics, and
   study site characteristics had on the magnitude of that relationship. We
   leveraged variation in study methodology to evaluate the extent to which
   results were sensitive to methodological choices often debated in the
   geographic and environmental justice literature but not yet evaluated in
   environmental amenities research.
   We found evidence of income-based inequity in urban forest cover
   (unconditional mean effect size = 0.098; s.e. = 0.017) that was robust
   across most measurement and methodological strategies in original
   studies. and results did not differ systematically with study site
   characteristics. Studies that controlled for spatial autocorrelation, a
   violation of independent errors, found evidence of substantially less
   urban forest inequity; future research in this area should test and
   correct for spatial autocorrelation.}},

Pages = {{214-227}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Understanding which aspects of forest governance have the potential to
   effectively reduce deforestation is central to reversing trends in
   global deforestation. There is a multitude of empirical studies
   examining this relationship using various measures of governance and
   study designs, coming to diverse conclusions. In order to identify the
   source of variation across studies, this article conducts a
   meta-analysis of 32 empirical cross-country studies in the field of
   economics, containing 227 estimates of the impact of different
   governance measures on deforestation. Using an ordered probit model, we
   find that the choice of the governance measure is the main factor in
   explaining variations in the outcomes of the studies. In particular,
   studies using environmental policy, ownership rights, presence of
   environmental NGOs, and rule of law as measures of governance, are more
   likely to find that better governance reduces deforestation. In
   contrast, studies using democracy and rights as a measure of governance
   are more likely to find that deforestation increases, when governance is
   improved. The finding that not all aspects of governance improvements
   are equally supportive of forest conservation suggests that more nuanced
   analyses of specific aspects of environmental governance are required to
   guide evidence based policy making.}},

Volume = {{252}},
Pages = {{126-131}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{It has been suggested that elevated nitrogen (N) deposition may increase
   soil N mineralization in N-limited ecosystems, but the underlying
   mechanisms have been not adequately explored. Soil N-acquisition enzymes
   play important roles on organic N mineralization. Thus, their responses
   to N deposition will be crucial for explaining the above phenomenon.
   Here, we conducted a meta-analysis from 64 studies to synthesize the
   responses of soil N-acquisition enzyme activities to N addition. Results
   showed that N addition significantly increased activities of
   N-acetylglucosaminidase and urease by 5.5\% and 11.6\%, respectively.
   However, N addition had negative or negligible effects on activities of
   protein-depolymerization enzymes, with no response for non-specific
   protease and leucine aminopeptidase but a significant decrease of 33.0\%
   for glycine aminopeptidase. Because protein comprises more than 60\% of
   the N in plant and microbial cells, and the protein depolymerization is
   an important rate-limiting step of organic N mineralization, the
   suppressed protein depolymerization indicates either that the changes to
   microbial activity may be not a dominant mechanism for the increased N
   mineralization in N-limited ecosystems with N addition, or that the
   increased N mineralization may be overvalued in the previous studies.}},

Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{315-324}},
Abstract = {{The general impact of extra nitrogen on ecological stoichiometry was
   examined in alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau. Extra nitrogen
   increased the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus (N:P ratio) in leaves and
   aboveground parts of plants by 43.4\% and 32.7\%, respectively. In
   contrast, extra nitrogen reduced the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N
   ratio) in leaves by 30.6\%. Extra nitrogen decreased soil C:N ratio by
   9.1\% in alpine meadows, but increased soil C:N ratio by 3.4\% in alpine
   steppes. Extra urea had a stronger positive impact on aboveground
   vegetation N:P ratio than did extra ammonium nitrate. Extra urea rather
   than ammonium nitrate decreased aboveground vegetation C:N ratio and
   soil C:N ratio. The impact of extra nitrogen on aboveground vegetation
   N:P ratio was positively correlated with latitude, mean annual
   temperature and precipitation, nitrogen application rate and accumulated
   amount, but negatively correlated with elevation, duration and
   aboveground vegetation N:P ratio of the control plots. The impact of

   enrichment caused by human activities will most likely alter element
   balance and alpine plants from nitrogen limitation to phosphorus
   limitation. This effect may weaken with time, and increase with climatic
   warming, increased precipitation and nitrogen input rate.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Logging to ``salvage{''} economic returns from forests affected by
   natural disturbances has become increasingly prevalent globally. Despite
   potential negative effects on biodiversity, salvage logging is often
   conducted, even in areas otherwise excluded from logging and reserved
   for nature conservation, inter alia because strategic priorities for
   post-disturbance management are widely lacking.
   2. A review of the existing literature revealed that most studies
   investigating the effects of salvage logging on biodiversity have been
   conducted less than 5years following natural disturbances, and focused
   on non-saproxylic organisms.
   3. A meta-analysis across 24 species groups revealed that salvage
   logging significantly decreases numbers of species of eight taxonomic
   groups. Richness of dead wood dependent taxa (i.e. saproxylic organisms)
   decreased more strongly than richness of non-saproxylic taxa. In
   contrast, taxonomic groups typically associated with open habitats
   increased in the number of species after salvage logging.
   4. By analysing 134 original species abundance matrices, we demonstrate
   that salvage logging significantly alters community composition in 7 of
   17 species groups, particularly affecting saproxylic assemblages.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that salvage logging
   is not consistent with the management objectives of protected areas.
   Substantial changes, such as the retention of dead wood in naturally
   disturbed forests, are needed to support biodiversity. Future research
   should investigate the amount and spatio-temporal distribution of
   retained dead wood needed to maintain all components of biodiversity.}},

   meta-regression of yields}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{251}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Conservation agriculture is widely promoted across sub-Saharan Africa as
   a sustainable farming practice that enhances adaptive capacity to
   climate change. The interactions between climate stress, management, and
   soil are critical to understanding the adaptive capacity of conservation
   agriculture. Yet conservation agriculture syntheses to date have largely
   neglected climate, especially the effects of extreme heat.
   For the sub-tropics and tropics, we use meta-regression, in combination
   with global soil and climate datasets, to test four hypotheses: (1) that
   relative yield performance of conservation agriculture improves with
   increasing drought and temperature stress; (2) that the effects of
   moisture and temperature stress exposure interact; (3) that the effects
   of moisture and temperature stress are modified by soil texture; and (4)
   that crop diversification, fertilizer application rate, or the time
   since no-till implementation will enhance conservation agriculture
   performance under climate stress.
   Our results support the hypothesis that the relative maize yield
   performance of conservation agriculture improves with increasing drought
   severity or exposure to high temperatures. Further, there is an
   interaction of moisture and heat stress on conservation agriculture
   performance and their combined effect is both non-additive and modified
   by soil clay content, supporting our second and third hypotheses.
   Finally, we found only limited support for our fourth hypothesis as (1)
   increasing nitrogen application rates did not improve the relative
   performance of conservation agriculture under high heat stress; (2) crop
   diversification did not notably improve conservation agriculture
   performance, but did increase its stability with heat stress; and (3) a
   statistically robust effect of the time since no-till implementation was
   not evident.
   Our meta-regression supports the narrative that conservation agriculture
   enhances the adaptive capacity of maize production in sub-Saharan Africa
   under drought and/or heat stress. However, in very wet seasons and on
   clay-rich soils, conservation agriculture yields less compared to
   conventional practices.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive research has shown that greater plant community diversity
   leads to higher levels of productivity and other ecosystem services, and
   such increased diversity has been suggested as a way to improve yield
   and agricultural sustainability. Increasing intraspecific diversity with
   cultivar mixtures is one way to increase diversity in agricultural
   systems. We examined the relationship between intraspecific diversity
   and yield in cultivar mixtures using a meta-analysis of 91 studies and
   >3,600 observations. Additionally, we investigated how environmental and
   management factors might influence this relationship, and if the yield
   stability of cultivar mixtures differed from that of monocultures. We
   found that the yield increased by 2.2\% overall in cultivar mixtures
   relative to their monoculture components. Mixtures with more cultivars
   and those with more functional trait diversity showed higher relative
   yields. Under biotic stressors, such as disease pressure, and abiotic
   stressors, such as low levels of soil organic matter and nutrient
   availability, this diversity effect was stronger, resulting in higher
   relative yields. Finally, cultivar mixtures generally showed higher
   yield stability compared to monocultures, especially in response to
   annual weather variability at a site over time. This practice of mixing
   cultivars can be integrated into intensified cropping systems where
   species monocultures dominate, as well as in smallholder cropping
   systems where low-cost improvements are in demand. Overall, these
   results suggest that cultivar mixtures are a viable strategy to increase
   diversity in agroecosystems, promoting increased yield and yield
   stability, with minimal environmental impact.}},

Abstract = {{Primary consumers are under strong selection from resource ('bottom-up')
   and consumer ('top-down') controls, but the relative importance of these

   considering multiple predictors that can modulate these effects: diet
   breadth, feeding guild, habitat/environment, type of bottom-up effects,
   type of top-down effects and how consumer fitness effects are measured.
   We focused our analyses on the most diverse group of primary consumers,
   herbivorous insects, and found that in general top-down forces were
   stronger than bottom-up forces. Notably, chewing, sucking and
   gall-making herbivores were more affected by top-down than bottom-up
   forces, top-down forces were stronger than bottom-up in both natural and
   controlled (cultivated) environments, and parasitoids and predators had
   equally strong top-down effects on insect herbivores. Future studies
   should broaden the scope of focal consumers, particularly in
   understudied terrestrial systems, guilds, taxonomic groups and top-down
   controls (e.g. pathogens), and test for more complex indirect community
   interactions. Our results demonstrate the surprising strength of forces

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Aim: The number of studies investigating the nestedness and turnover
   components of beta diversity has increased substantially, but our
   general understanding of the drivers of turnover and nestedness remains
   elusive. Here, we examined the effects of species traits, spatial
   extent, latitude and ecosystem type on the nestedness and turnover
   components of beta diversity.
   Location: Global. Time period: 1968-2017.
   Major taxa studied: From bacteria to mammals.
   Methods: From the 99 studies that partition total beta diversity into
   its turnover and nestedness components, we assembled 269 and 259 data
   points for the pairwise and multiple site beta-diversity metrics,
   respectively. Our data covered a broad variation in species dispersal
   type, body size and trophic position. The data were from freshwater,
   marine and terrestrial realms, and encompassed geographical areas from
   the tropics to near polar regions. We used linear modelling as a
   meta-regression tool to analyse the data.
   Results: Pairwise turnover, multiple site turnover and total beta
   diversity all decreased significantly with latitude. In contrast,
   multiple site nestedness showed a positive relationship with latitude.
   Beta-diversity components did not generally differ among the realms. The
   turnover component and total beta diversity increased with spatial
   extent, whereas nestedness was scale invariant for pairwise metrics.
   Multiple site beta-diversity components did not vary with spatial
   extent. Surprisingly, passively dispersed organisms had lower turnover
   and total beta diversity than flying organisms. Body size showed a
   relatively weak relationship with beta diversity but had important
   interactions with trophic position, thus also affecting beta diversity
   via interactive effects. Producers had significantly higher average
   pairwise turnover and total beta diversity than carnivores.
   Main conclusions: The present results provide evidence that species
   turnover, being consistently the larger component of total beta
   diversity, and nestedness are related to the latitude of the study area
   and intrinsic organismal features. We showed that two beta-diversity
   components had generally opposing patterns with regard to latitude. We
   highlight that beta-diversity partition may give additional insights
   into the underlying causes of spatial variability in biotic communities
   compared with total beta diversity alone.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The aim was to explore how conversions of primary or secondary
   forests to plantations or agricultural systems influence soil microbial
   communities and soil carbon (C) cycling.
   Location: Global.
   Time period: 1993-2017.
   Major taxa studied: Soil microbes.
   Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to examine effects of forest
   degradation on soil properties and microbial attributes related to
   microbial biomass, activity, community composition and diversity based
   on 408 cases from 119 studies in the world.
   Results: Forest degradation decreased the ratios of K-strategists to
   r-strategists (i.e., ratios of fungi to bacteria, Acidobacteria to
   Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria to Bacteroidetes and
   Acidobacteria+Actinobacteria to Proteobacteria+Bacteroidetes). The
   response ratios (RRs) of the K-strategist to r-strategist ratios to
   forest degradation decreased and increased with increased RRs of soil pH
   and soil C to nitrogen ratio (C:N), respectively. Forest degradation
   increased the bacterial alpha-diversity indexes, of which the RRs
   increased and decreased as the RRs of soil pH and soil C: N increased,
   respectively. The overall RRs across all the forest degradation types
   ranked as microbial C (-40.4\%)> soil C (-33.3\%)> microbial respiration
   (-18.9\%)> microbial C to soil C ratio (qMBC; -15.9\%), leading to the
   RRs of microbial respiration rate per unit microbial C (qCO(2)) and soil
   C decomposition rate (respiration rate per unit soil C), on average,
   increasing by +43.2 and +25.0\%, respectively. Variances of the RRs of
   qMBC and qCO(2) were significantly explained by the soil C, soil C: N
   and mean annual precipitation.
   Main conclusions: Forest degradation consistently shifted soil microbial
   community compositions from K-strategist dominated to r-strategist
   dominated, altered soil properties and stimulated microbial activity and
   soil C decomposition. These results are important for modelling the soil
   C cycling under projected global land-use changes and provide supportive
   evidence for applying the macroecology theory on ecosystem succession
   and disturbance in soil microbial ecology.}},

   pattern across many different organisms and locations. Our goal was to
   quantify the evidence for the global LDG and the associated spatial,
   taxonomic and environmental factors. We performed a meta-analysis on a
   large number of individual LDGs that have been published in the 14 years
   since Hillebrand's ground-breaking meta-analysis of the LDG, using
   meta-analysis and metaregression approaches largely new to the fields of
   ecology and biogeography.
   Location: Global.
   Time period: January 2003-September 2015.
   Major taxa studied: Bacteria, protists, plants, fungi and animals.
   Methods: We synthesized the outcomes of 389 individual cases of LDGs
   from 199 papers published since 2003, using hierarchical mixed-effects
   meta-analysis and multiple meta-regression. Additionally, we re-analysed
   Hillebrand's original dataset using modern methods.
   Results: We confirmed the generality of the LDG, but found the pattern
   to be weaker than was found in Hillebrand's study. We identified
   previously unreported variation in LDG strength and slope across
   longitude, with evidence that the LDG is strongest in the Western
   Hemisphere. Locational characteristics, such as habitat and latitude
   range, contributed significantly to LDG strength, whereas organismal
   characteristics, including taxonomic group and trophic level, did not.
   Modern meta-analytical models that incorporate hierarchical structure
   led to more conservative and sometimes contrasting effect size estimates
   relative to Hillebrand's initial analysis, whereas metaregression
   revealed underlying patterns in Hillebrand's dataset that were not
   apparent with a traditional analysis.
   Main conclusions: We present evidence of global latitudinal,
   longitudinal and habitat-based patterns in the LDG, which are apparent
   across both marine and terrestrial realms and over a broad taxonomic
   range of organisms, from bacteria to plants and vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{1. Biological invasions pose a serious threat to biodiversity and
   ecosystem functioning across ecosystems. Invasions by ecosystem
   engineers, in particular, have been shown to have dramatic effects in
   recipient ecosystems. For instance, invasion by earthworms, a
   below-ground invertebrate ecosystem engineer, in previously
   earthworm-free ecosystems alters the physico-chemical characteristics of
   the soil. Studies have shown that such alterations in the soil can have
   far-reaching impacts on soil organisms, which form a major portion of
   terrestrial biodiversity.
   2. Here, we present the first quantitative synthesis of earthworm
   invasion effects on soil micro-organisms and soil invertebrates based on
   430 observations from 30 independent studies.
   3. Our meta-analysis shows a significant decline of the diversity and
   density of soil invertebrates in response to earthworm invasion with
   anecic and endogeic earthworms causing the strongest effects. Earthworm
   invasion effects on soil micro-organisms were context-dependent, such as
   depending on functional group richness of invasive earthworms and soil
   depth. Microbial biomass and diversity increased in mineral soil layers,
   with a weak negative effect in organic soil layers, indicating that the
   mixing of soil layers by earthworms (bioturbation) may homogenize
   microbial communities across soil layers.
   4. Our meta-analysis provides a compelling evidence for negative effects
   of a common invasive below-ground ecosystem engineer on below-ground
   biodiversity of recipient ecosystems, which could potentially alter the
   ecosystem functions and services linked to soil biota.}},

Abstract = {{1. Migratory animals are widely assumed to play an important role in the
   long-distance dispersal of parasites, and are frequently implicated in
   the global spread of zoonotic pathogens such as avian influenzas in
   birds and Ebola viruses in bats. However, infection imposes
   physiological and behavioural constraints on hosts that may act to
   curtail parasite dispersal via changes to migratory timing
   ({''}migratory separation{''}) and survival ({''}migratory culling{''}).
   2. There remains little consensus regarding the frequency and extent to
   which migratory separation and migratory culling may operate, despite a
   growing recognition of the importance of these mechanisms in regulating
   transmission dynamics in migratory animals.
   3. We quantitatively reviewed 85 observations extracted from 41 studies
   to examine how both infection status and infection intensity are related
   to changes in body stores, refuelling rates, movement capacity,
   phenology and survival in migratory hosts across taxa.
   4. Overall, host infection status was weakly associated with reduced
   body stores, delayed migration and lower survival, and more strongly
   associated with reduced movement. Infection intensity was not associated
   with changes to host body stores, but was associated with moderate
   negative effects on movement, phenology and survival.
   5. In conclusion, we found evidence for negative effects of infection on
   host phenology and survival, but the effects were relatively small. This
   may have implications for the extent to which migratory separation and
   migratory culling act to limit parasite dispersal in migratory systems.
   We propose a number of recommendations for future research that will
   further advance our understanding of how migratory separation and
   migratory culling may shape host-parasite dynamics along migratory
   routes globally.}},

Abstract = {{Scattered trees are thought to be keystone structures for biodiversity
   in landscapes world-wide. However, such trees have been largely
   neglected by researchers and their importance for biodiversity remains
   unclear.
   We completed a global meta-analysis to quantify relationships between
   scattered trees and the species richness, abundance and composition of
   vertebrates, arthropods and plants. First, we tested whether areas near
   scattered trees support higher levels of species richness and abundance
   than nearby open areas. Second, we compared levels of species richness
   and abundance in matrix areas with scattered trees and areas embedded
   within nearby habitat patches. We also compared the composition of
   biological communities inhabiting habitat patches, open areas and areas
   with scattered trees.
   A total of 62 studies contained suitable data for our quantitative
   analyses. The local abundance of arthropods, vertebrates and woody
   plants was 60\%-430\% greater and overall species richness was
   50\%-100\% higher in areas with scattered trees than in open areas.
   Conversely, for herbaceous plants, there was no consistent relationship
   between species abundance and the occurrence of scattered trees,
   although species richness was, on average, 43\% lower.
   The abundance and richness of all taxonomic groups was similar in matrix
   areas supporting scattered trees and habitat patches, although the
   species richness of epiphytes was, on average, 50\% higher in habitat
   patches. Communities inhabiting habitat patches were more similar in
   composition to the communities inhabiting areas with scattered trees,
   and less similar to the communities of open areas.
   Synthesis and applications. Areas with scattered trees support greater
   levels of biodiversity than open areas, as well as communities that are
   more similar to those inhabiting habitat patches. Scattered trees can be
   regarded as keystone structures for vertebrates, arthropods and
   terrestrial plants in landscapes world-wide. The maintenance of
   scattered trees may be compatible with livestock grazing in some
   agricultural landscapes. Greater management effort and targeted,
   long-term policies are needed to retain or re-establish scattered trees

Abstract = {{Subterranean detritivores such as earthworms can increase soil nutrient
   availability through their burrowing and casting activities. A number of
   recent studies have explored whether these changes caused by earthworms
   may in turn affect plant performance and resistance to herbivores, but
   no formal synthesis of this literature has been conducted to date.
   We tested for the effects of earthworms on plant growth, resistance and
   chemical defences against insect herbivores by performing a
   meta-analysis of the existing literature up to 2016. We also explored
   ecological factors that might explain among-studies variation in the
   magnitude of the earthworm effects on plant growth and resistance.
   We found that earthworm presence increases plant growth (by 20\%) and
   nitrogen content (by 11\%). Overall, earthworms did not affect plant
   resistance against chewing herbivores (caterpillars, slugs and
   rootworms), and even led to a 22\% decrease in plant resistance against
   phloem-feeding herbivores (aphids). However, earthworm presence
   increased production of chemical defences by 31\% when plants where
   attacked by cell-feeders (thrips), and resulted in an 81\% increase in
   resistance against thrips. The magnitude of earthworm effects was
   stronger when earthworm inoculations consisted of a mix of species and
   ecological types, and when densities of earthworms were high.
   These results suggest that earthworm presence is an important factor
   underlying natural variation in plant defences against herbivores, and
   call for a better integration of the soil fauna in the studies of
   plant-herbivore interaction, both for applied and fundamental research.

Abstract = {{Harvesting of marine invertebrates in intertidal areas often comes into
   conflict with conservation objectives for waterbird populations of the
   orders Anseriformes and Charadri-iformes. We present a meta-analysis of
   the relationships between benthic invertebrate communities and various
   sources of intertidal harvesting disturbance to investigate impacts and
   recovery in bird prey resources. The effect size (Hedges' d) of
   harvesting on benthic species abundance, diversity and biomass was
   calculated for 38 studies in various locations globally, derived from 16
   publications captured through a systematic review process that met the
   meta-analysis inclusion criteria. A negative response to harvesting
   disturbance was found for all taxa, including both target and non-target
   species, that represent important types of waterbird prey. Impacts
   appear most severe from hand-gathering, which significantly reduces the
   abundance of target polychaete species, a key prey group for many bird
   species. Across all gear types, non-target species demonstrate a larger
   reduction in abundance compared to target species. Recovery trends vary,
   with differences observed between taxonomic groups and gear/habitat
   combinations. Abundance of bivalve molluscs, a potentially highly
   profitable bird prey item, is suppressed for > 60 d by mechanical
   dredging in intertidal mud, while annelid and crustacean abundances
   demonstrate near recovery over the same period. Data suggest that
   recovery following harvesting in sandier habitats may in some cases take
   as long as or longer than in muddy sediments. We recommend management
   measures to minimise disturbance to benthic prey resources and support

Abstract = {{Drought is one of the abiotic stresses controlling plant function and
   ecological stability. In the context of climate change, drought is
   predicted to occur more frequently in the future. Despite numerous
   attempts to clarify the overall effects of drought stress on the growth
   and physiological processes of plants, a comprehensive evaluation on the
   impacts of drought stress on biomass allocation, especially on
   reproductive tissues, remains elusive. We conducted a meta-analysis by
   synthesizing 164 published studies to elucidate patterns of plant
   biomass allocation in relation to drought stress. Results showed that
   drought significantly increased the fraction of root mass but decreased
   that of stem, leaf, and reproductive mass. Roots of herbaceous plants
   were more sensitive to drought than woody plants that reduced
   reproductive allocation more sharply than the former. Relative to
   herbaceous plants, drought had a more negative impact on leaf mass
   fraction of woody plants. Among the herbaceous plants, roots of annuals
   responded to drought stress more strongly than perennial herbs, but
   their reproductive allocation was less sensitive to drought than the
   perennial herbs. In addition, cultivated and wild plants seemed to
   respond to drought stress in a similar way. Drought stress did not
   change the scaling exponents of the allometric relationship between
   different plant tissues. These findings suggest that the allometric
   partitioning theory, rather than the optimal partitioning theory, better
   explains the drought-induced changes in biomass allocation strategies.}},

Volume = {{54}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Reliance on ecosystem services instead of synthetic, non-renewable
   inputs is increasingly seen as key to achieving food security in an
   environmentally sustainable way. This process, known as ecological
   intensification, will depend in large part on enhancing below-ground
   biological interactions that facilitate resource use efficiency.
   Arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM), associations formed between the roots of
   most terrestrial plant species and a specialized group of soil fungi,
   provide valuable ecosystem services, but the full magnitude of these
   services may not be fully realized under conventional intensively
   managed annual agricultural systems.
   2. Here, we use meta-analysis to assess how reducing soil disturbance
   and periods without roots in agricultural systems affect the formation
   of AM and the diversity and community composition of arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). We compiled data from 54 field studies across
   five continents that measured effects of tillage and/or cover cropping
   on AMF colonization and/or communities and assessed effects of
   management and environmental factors on these responses.
   3. Less intensive tillage and winter cover cropping similarly increased
   AMF colonization of summer annual cash crop roots by similar to 30\%.
   The key variables influencing the change in AMF colonization were the
   type of cover crop or the type of alternative tillage, suggesting that
   farmers can optimize combinations of tillage and cover crops that most
   enhance AM formation, particularly with no-till systems and legume cover
   crops.
   4. Richness of AMF taxa increased by 11\% in low-intensity vs.
   conventional tillage regimes. Several studies showed changes in
   diversity and community composition of AMF with cover cropping, but
   these responses were not consistent.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This meta-analysis indicates that less
   intensive tillage and cover cropping are both viable strategies for
   enhancing root colonization from indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   (AMF) across a wide range of soil types and cash crop species, and
   possibly also shifting AMF community structure, which could in turn
   increase biologically based resource use in agricultural systems.}},

Abstract = {{Many bird species are advancing the timing of their egg-laying in
   response to a warming climate. Little is known, however, of whether this
   advancement affects the respective length of the breeding seasons. A
   meta-analysis of 65 long-term studies of 54 species from the Northern
   Hemisphere has revealed that within the last 45 years an average
   population has lengthened the season by 1.4 days per decade, which was
   independent from changes in mean laying dates. Multi-brooded birds have
   prolonged their seasons by 4 days per decade, while single-brooded have
   shortened by 2 days. Changes in season lengths covaried with local
   climate changes: warmingwas correlated with prolonged seasons in
   multi-brooded species, but not in single-brooders. This might be a
   result of higher ecological flexibility of multi-brooded birds, whereas
   single brooders may have problems with synchronizing their reproduction
   with the peak of food resources. Sedentary species and short-distance
   migrants prolonged their breeding seasons more than long-distance
   migrants, which probably cannot track conditions at their breeding
   grounds. We conclude that as long as climatewarming continues without
   major changes in ecological conditions, multi-brooded or sedentary

   opposite effect may occur in single-brooded or migratory birds.}},

Volume = {{215}},
Pages = {{30-38}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Rapid human-induced conversion and degradation of natural habitats has
   severely altered patterns of species occupancy and population viability.
   Primates are highly vulnerable to tropical forest loss and degradation
   because they are highly arboreal, forest-dependent, and often highly
   sensitive to changes in forest structure. Here we quantify the effects
   of anthropogenic habitat modification on primate community structure
   using a global meta-analysis based on 72 studies to understand the
   variation in effect sizes between biogeographic regions, types of human
   disturbance, trophic levels of primate species, and sampling design
   protocols. We examined response ratios for 637 comparisons between
   disturbed forests and adjacent `pseudo-control' forests with a history
   of little or no impact. This revealed an overall decrease of 30\% (95\%
   CI: 17-43\%) in biodiversity metrics in response to habitat disturbance,
   which was particularly detrimental to primate assemblages in Madagascar
   and Southeast Asia. This effect was more severe in areas converted to
   agriculture (77\%; 95\% CI: 59-88\%), while land use intensification led
   to far more detrimental effects than the initial degradation of forests,
   calling for the identification of habitat degradation thresholds.
   Negative effects of forest degradation were further exacerbated by
   similar to 30\% under scenarios of persistent hunting pressure,
   emphasizing possible synergistic interactions between environmental
   stressors. Given that overall primate diversity was depressed in
   degraded habitats, our results emphasize the importance of retaining
   connectivity across remnants of undisturbed primary forest within
   human-modified landscapes to maintain full complements of primate
   species, and ensure their long-term persistence.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesChildhood is a unique stage in human life history, in which
   subadults have completed their weaning process but are still dependent
   on older individuals for survival. Although the importance of food
   provisioning during childhood has been intensively discussed, childhood
   diet in the past has rarely been studied in a systematic manner.
   MethodsIn this study, a meta-analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable
   isotope ratios of post-weaning children (PWC) in Holocene human
   populations around the world is presented. The isotope ratios of PWC
   were standardized with those of adult females and males in the same
   population, and they were analyzed in terms of the difference in
   subsistence.
   ResultsResults of this study indicate that diets of PWC and adults were
   generally similar (most differences were within the range of 1 parts per
   thousand), which is consistent with the universal feature of food
   provisioning to PWC in humans. In huntergatherer populations, there is
   no significant difference between PWC and adult isotope ratios. In
   non-huntergatherer populations, however, PWC probably consumed
   significantly larger proportions of foods from lower trophic levels than
   did the adults, and such foods would be terrestrial C-3 plants.
   ConclusionsPotential factors relating to the dietary differences among
   PWC and adults are presented from a perspective of balance between food
   provisioning and self-acquisition by PWC. Significant isotopic
   differences between PWC and adults in non-huntergatherer populations
   revealed in this study have implications for declined health during the
   subsistence transition in Holocene, isotopic studies using human tooth
   enamel, and N-15 dip of subadults after weaning.}},

Title = {{Quantifying the influence of urban land use on mangrove biology and

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Aim: The aim was to quantify the influence of urban land use and urban
   populations on mangrove systems around the world over the past four
   decades.
   Location: Global. Time period: 1997-2015.
   Major taxa studied: Avicennia, Laguncularia, Rhizophora, Aves,
   Actinopterygii, Crustacea and Mollusca.
   Methods: This review extracts results of mangrove studies on forest
   cover and structure, nutrient dynamics, sediment contamination and
   faunal community assemblages conducted around the world between 1997 and
   2015. These observations are then correlated with surrounding
   social-ecological spatial characteristics pertaining to urbanization.
   Results: Mangrove coverage in large cities is mostly decreasing, and at
   a greater rate than means for corresponding countries. Both expanding
   urbanization and existing agriculture are most strongly correlated with
   mangrove losses, which are primarily occurring 5-10 km from urban areas.
   Along a gradient of surrounding urban land use, mangrove leaf delta N-15
   content increases, and leaf carbon to nitrogen ratios decrease. Sediment
   concentrations of almost all examined heavy metals are strongly and
   positively correlated with both surrounding urban and mangrove extent.
   The diversity of subsistence fisheries increases significantly with
   surrounding mangrove extent. Worm diversity decreases with increasing
   surrounding urbanness (urban index), and mangrove specialist bird
   diversity increases with increasing surrounding urban coverage as well
   as with mangrove coverage.
   Main conclusions: Mangroves increasingly coexist within highly
   anthropogenic landscapes along urbanized coasts. Most ecological reports
   of these systems, however, lack quantified representations of the urban
   landscape, such as population density or impervious surface coverage.
   The results of this analysis suggest that some of the reported patterns
   of forest coverage, nitrogen dynamics, heavy metal contamination and
   faunal community assemblages in isolated urban mangroves are systemic
   across the world. These findings are particularly pertinent to 21st
   century tropical coastlines, which will see some of the greatest
   urbanization rates over the next century and will guide urban mangrove
   ecology towards the development of more synergistic social-ecological
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection results in the evolution of exaggerated secondary

   where sexual ornaments honestly reflect individual quality, the
   viability cost of secondary sexual characters may be overwhelmed by
   variation in individual quality, leading to expect that individuals with
   the largest secondary sexual characters show higher, rather than lower
   viability. Here, we used meta-analyses to test whether such expected
   positive relationship between sexual ornamentation and viability exists
   in the barn swallow Hirundo rustica, which is one of the most studied
   model species of sexual selection under field conditions. We found a
   mean positive effect size of viability in relation to the expression of
   secondary sexual characters of 0.181 (CI: 0.084-0.278), indicating that
   in this species the more ornamented individuals are more viable, and
   therefore of high quality. Analyses of moderator variables showed
   similar effects in males and females, the H.r.rustica subspecies rather
   than others and tail length rather than other secondary sexual

   European one and secondary sexual characters than tail length may help
   identify the sources of heterogeneity in effect sizes.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing affects over 60\% of the world's agricultural lands
   and can influence rangeland ecosystem services and the quantity and
   quality of wildlife habitat, resulting in changes in biodiversity.
   Concomitantly, livestock grazing has the potential to be detrimental to
   some wildlife species while benefiting other rangeland organisms. Many
   imperiled grouse species require rangeland landscapes that exhibit
   diverse vegetation structure and composition to complete their life
   cycle. However, because of declining populations and reduced
   distributions, grouse are increasingly becoming a worldwide conservation
   concern. Grouse, as a suite of upland gamebirds, are often considered an
   umbrella species for other wildlife and thus used as indicators of
   rangeland health. With a projected increase in demand for livestock
   products, better information will be required to mitigate the
   anthropogenic effects of livestock grazing on rangeland biodiversity. To
   address this need, we completed a data-driven and systematic review of
   the peer-reviewed literature to determine the current knowledge of the
   effects of livestock grazing on grouse populations (i.e., chick
   production and population indices) worldwide. Our meta-analysis revealed
   an overall negative effect of livestock grazing on grouse populations.
   Perhaps more importantly, we identified an information void regarding
   the effects of livestock grazing on the majority of grouse species.
   Additionally, the reported indirect effects of livestock grazing on
   grouse species were inconclusive and more reflective of differences in
   the experimental design of the available studies. Future studies
   designed to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of livestock
   grazing on wildlife should document (i) livestock type, (ii) timing and
   frequency of grazing, (iii) duration, and (iv) stocking rate. Much of
   this information was lacking in the available published studies we
   reviewed, but is essential when making comparisons between different
   livestock grazing management practices and their potential impacts on
   rangeland biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Animal manure application as organic fertilizer does not only sustain
   agricultural productivity and increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks,
   but also affects soil nitrogen cycling and nitrous oxide (N2O)
   emissions. However, given that the sign and magnitude of manure effects
   on soil N2O emissions is uncertain, the net climatic impact of manure
   application in arable land is unknown. Here, we performed a global
   meta-analysis using field experimental data published in peer-reviewed
   journals prior to December 2015. In this meta-analysis, we quantified
   the responses of N2O emissions to manure application relative to
   synthetic N fertilizer application from individual studies and analyzed
   manure characteristics, experimental duration, climate, and soil
   properties as explanatory factors. Manure application significantly
   increased N2O emissions by an average 32.7\% (95\% confidence interval:
   5.1-58.2\%) compared to application of synthetic N fertilizer alone. The
   significant stimulation of N2O emissions occurred following cattle and
   poultry manure applications, subsurface manure application, and raw
   manure application. Furthermore, the significant stimulatory effects on
   N2O emissions were also observed for warm temperate climate, acid soils
   (pH < 6.5), and soil texture classes of sandy loam and clay loam.
   Average direct N2O emission factors (EFs) of 1.87\% and 0.24\% were
   estimated for upland soils and rice paddy soils receiving manure
   application, respectively. Although manure application increased SOC
   stocks, our study suggested that the benefit of increasing SOC stocks as
   GHG sinks could be largely offset by stimulation of soil N2O emissions
   and aggravated by CH4 emissions if, particularly for rice paddy soils,
   the stimulation of CH4 emissions by manure application was taken into
   account.}},

Abstract = {{A growing body of literature seeks to explain variation in range shifts

   geographic distributions sampled in the 20th century prior to climate
   change with resurveys of distributions after contemporary climate change
   and then tested whether species traits accounted for heterogeneity in

   of body size, fecundity, diet breadth, habitat breadth, and historic
   range limit as predictors of range shifts for a subset of 21 studies of
   26 assemblages with sufficient data. Range shifts were consistent with
   predictions based on habitat breadth and historic range limit. However,
   body size, fecundity, and diet breadth showed no significant effect on
   range shifts across studies, and multiple studies reported significant

Abstract = {{The adoption of less intensive soil cultivation practices is expected to
   increase earthworm populations and their contributions to ecosystem
   functioning. However, conflicting results have been reported on the
   effects of tillage intensity on earthworm populations, attributed in
   narrative reviews to site-dependent differences in soil properties,
   climatic conditions and agronomic operations (e.g. fertilization,
   residue management and chemical crop protection). We present a
   quantitative review based on a global meta-analysis, using paired
   observations from 165 publications performed over 65 years (1950-2016)
   across 40 countries on five continents, to elucidate this long-standing
   unresolved issue. Results showed that disturbing the soil less (e.g.
   no-tillage and conservation agriculture {[}CA]) significantly increased
   earthworm abundance (mean increase of 137\% and 127\%, respectively) and
   biomass (196\% and 101\%, respectively) compared to when the soil is
   inverted by conventional ploughing. Earthworm population responses were
   more pronounced when the soil had been under reduced tillage (RT) for a
   long time (>10 years), in warm temperate zones with fine-textured soils,
   and in soils with higher clay contents (>35\%) and low pH (<5.5).
   Furthermore, retaining organic harvest residues amplified this positive
   response to RT, whereas the use of the herbicide glyphosate did not
   significantly affect earthworm population responses to RT. Additional
   meta-analyses confirmed that epigeic and, more importantly, the
   bigger-sized anecic earthworms were the most sensitive ecological groups
   to conventional tillage. In particular, the deep burrower Lumbricus
   terrestris exhibited the strongest positive response to RT, increasing
   in abundance by 124\% more than the overall mean of all 13 species
   analysed individually. The restoration of these two important ecological
   groups of earthworms and their burrowing, feeding and casting activities
   under various forms of RT will ensure the provision of ecosystem
   functions such as soil structure maintenance and nutrient cycling by

Abstract = {{1. The far-reaching impacts of livestock grazing in terrestrial
   grasslands are widely appreciated, but how livestock affect the
   structure and functions of sensitive coastal ecosystems has hitherto
   lacked synthesis. Grazing-induced changes in salt marshes have the
   potential to alter the provision of valuable ecosystem services, such as
   coastal protection, blue carbon and biodiversity conservation.
   2. To investigate how livestock alter soil, vegetation and faunal
   properties in salt marshes, we conducted a global meta-analysis of
   ungulate grazer impacts on commonly measured ecosystem properties (498
   individual responses from 89 studies). We also tested stocking density,
   grazing duration, grazer identity, continent and vegetation type as
   potential modifiers of the grazing effect. The majority of studies were
   conducted in Europe (75) or the Americas (12), and investigated cattle
   (43) or sheep (22) grazing.
   3. All measures of above-ground plant material (height, cover,
   above-ground biomass, litter) were decreased by grazing, potentially
   impairing coastal protection through diminished wave attenuation.
   4. Soil carbon was reduced by grazing in American, but not European
   marshes, indicating a trade-off with climate regulation that varies
   geographically. Additionally, grazing increased soil bulk density,
   salinity and daytime temperature, and reduced redox potential.
   5. Biodiversity responses depended on focal group, with positive effects
   of grazing on vegetation species richness, but negative effects on
   invertebrate richness. Grazing reduced the abundance of herbivorous
   invertebrates, which may affect fish and crustaceans that feed in the
   marsh. Overall vertebrate abundance was not affected, but there was
   provisional evidence for increases over a longer duration of grazing,
   potentially increasing birdwatching and wildfowling opportunities.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that the use of salt
   marshes for livestock production affects multiple ecosystem properties,
   creating trade-offs and synergies with other ecosystem services. Grazing
   leads to reductions in blue carbon in the Americas but not in Europe.
   Grazing may compromise coastal protection and the provision of a nursery
   habitat for fish while creating provisioning and cultural benefits
   through increased wildfowl abundance. These findings can inform salt
   marsh grazing management, based on local context and desired ecosystem
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Predicting the potential for climate change to disrupt host-microbe
   symbioses requires basic knowledge of the biogeography of these
   consortia. In plants, fungal symbionts can ameliorate the abiotic
   stressors that accompany climate warming and thus could influence plants
   under a changing climate. Forecasting future plant-microbe interactions
   first requires knowledge of current fungal symbiont distributions, which
   are poorly resolved relative to the distributions of plants.
   Location: We used meta-analysis to summarize the biogeographic
   distributions of plant-fungal symbionts in mountain ecosystems
   worldwide, because these ecosystems are likely to be among the first to
   experience climate change-induced range shifts.
   Methods: We analysed 374 records from 53 publications to identify
   general trends, pinpoint areas in need of greater study and develop
   reporting guidelines to facilitate future syntheses.
   Results: Elevational patterns varied strongly among fungal and plant
   functional groups. Fungal diversity and abundance increased with
   altitude for the ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi and localized foliar endophytes declined in either abundance or
   diversity with altitude. In shrubs, fungal abundance increased with
   elevation, but in C-3 grasses, fungal abundance declined with elevation.
   Altitudinal patterns in fungal composition were stronger than gradients
   in fungal abundance or diversity, suggesting that species turnover
   contributes more to elevational gradients in fungal symbionts than does
   variation in abundance or richness. Plant functional groups were
   overrepresented by C-3 grasses and trees, with surprisingly few data on
   sedges or shrubs, despite their ecological dominance in mountain
   ecosystems. Similarly, epichloae, ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and root
   endophytes were understudied relative to other fungal groups.
   Main Conclusions: Meta-analysis revealed broad biogeographic patterns in
   plant-fungal symbiont abundance, diversity and composition that inform
   predictions of future distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Although many selection estimates have been published, the environmental
   factors that cause selection to vary in space and time have rarely been
   identified. One way to identify these factors is by experimentally
   manipulating the environment and measuring selection in each treatment.
   We compiled and analyzed selection estimates from experimental studies.
   First, we tested whether the effect of manipulating the environment on
   selection gradients depends on taxon, trait type, or fitness component.
   We found that the effect of manipulating the environment was larger when
   selection was measured on life-history traits or via survival. Second,
   we tested two predictions about the environmental factors that cause
   variation in selection. We found support for the prediction that
   variation in selection is more likely to be caused by environmental
   factors that have a large effect on mean fitness but not for the
   prediction that variation is more likely to be caused by biotic factors.
   Third, we compared selection gradients from experimental and
   observational studies. We found that selection varied more among
   treatments in experimental studies than among spatial and temporal
   replicates in observational studies, suggesting that experimental
   studies can detect relationships between environmental factors and
   selection that would not be apparent in observational studies.}},

Abstract = {{Requirements for mitigation of the continued increase in greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions are much needed for the North China Plain (NCP). We
   conducted a meta-analysis of 76 published studies of 24 sites in the NCP
   to examine the effects of natural conditions and farming practices on
   GHG emissions in that region. We found that N2O was the main component
   of the area-scaled total GHG balance, and the CH4 contribution was <5\%.
   Precipitation, temperature, soil pH, and texture had no significant
   impacts on annual GHG emissions, because of limited variation of these
   factors in the NCP. The N2O emissions increased exponentially with
   mineral fertilizer N application rate, with y=0.2389e(0.0058x) for wheat
   season and y=0.365e(0.0071x) for maize season. Emission factors were
   estimated at 0.37\% for wheat and 0.90\% for maize at conventional
   fertilizer N application rates. The agronomic optimal N rates (241 and
   185kgNha(-1) for wheat and maize, respectively) exhibited great
   potential for reducing N2O emissions, by 0.39 (29\%) and 1.71
   (56\%)kgN(2)O-Nha(-1)season(-1) for the wheat and maize seasons,
   respectively. Mixed application of organic manure with reduced mineral
   fertilizer N could reduce annual N2O emissions by 16\% relative to
   mineral N application alone while maintaining a high crop yield.
   Compared with conventional tillage, no-tillage significantly reduced N2O
   emissions by 30\% in the wheat season, whereas it increased those
   emissions by 10\% in the maize season. This may have resulted from the
   lower soil temperature in winter and increased soil moisture in summer
   under no-tillage practice. Straw incorporation significantly increased
   annual N2O emissions, by 26\% relative to straw removal. Our analysis
   indicates that these farming practices could be further tested to
   mitigate GHG emission and maintain high crop yields in the NCP.}},

Abstract = {{1. Variation in aerobic capacity has far reaching consequences for the
   physiology, ecology, and evolution of vertebrates. Whether at rest or
   active, animals are constrained to operate within the energetic bounds
   determined by their minimum (minMR) and sustained or maximum metabolic
   rates (upperMR). MinMR and upperMR can differ considerably among
   individuals and species but are often presumed to be mechanistically
   linked to one another. Specifically, minMR is thought to reflect the
   idling cost of the machinery needed to support upperMR. However,
   previous analyses based on limited datasets have come to conflicting
   conclusions regarding the generality and strength of their association.
   2. Here we conduct the first comprehensive assessment of their
   relationship, based on a large number of published estimates of both the
   intra-specific (n = 176) and inter-specific (n = 41) phenotypic
   correlations between minMR and upperMR, estimated as either
   exercise-induced maximum metabolic rate (VO(2)max), cold-induced summit
   metabolic rate (Msum), or daily energy expenditure (DEE).
   3. Our meta-analysis shows that there is a general positive association
   between minMR and upperMR that is shared among vertebrate taxonomic
   classes. However, there was stronger evidence for intra-specific
   correlations between minMR and Msum and between minMR and DEE than there
   was for a correlation between minMR and VO(2)max across different taxa.
   As expected, inter-specific correlation estimates were consistently
   higher than intra-specific estimates across all traits and vertebrate
   classes.
   4. An interesting exception to this general trend was observed in
   mammals, which contrast with birds and exhibit no correlation between
   minMR and Msum. We speculate that this is due to the evolution and
   recruitment of brown fat as a thermogenic tissue, which illustrates how
   some species and lineages might circumvent this seemingly general
   association.
   5. We conclude that, in spite of some variability across taxa and
   traits, the contention that minMR and upperMR are positively correlated
   generally holds true both within and across vertebrate species.
   Ecological and comparative studies should therefore take into
   consideration the possibility that variation in any one of these traits
   might partly reflect correlated responses to selection on other
   metabolic parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of herbivore-plant and soil biota-plant interactions in
   terrestrial ecosystems is amply recognized, but the effects of
   aboveground herbivores on soil biota remain challenging to predict. To
   find global patterns in belowground responses to vertebrate herbivores,
   we performed a meta-analysis of studies that had measured abundance or
   activity of soil organisms inside and outside field exclosures (areas
   that excluded herbivores). Responses were often controlled by climate,
   ecosystem type, and dominant herbivore identity. Soil microfauna and
   especially root-feeding nematodes were negatively affected by herbivores
   in subarctic sites. In arid ecosystems, herbivore presence tended to
   reduce microbial biomass and nitrogen mineralization. Herbivores
   decreased soil respiration in subarctic ecosystems and increased it in
   temperate ecosystems, but had no net effect on microbial biomass or
   nitrogen mineralization in those ecosystems. Responses of soil fauna,
   microbial biomass, and nitrogen mineralization shifted from neutral to
   negative with increasing herbivore body size. Responses of animal
   decomposers tended to switch from negative to positive with increasing
   precipitation, but also differed among taxa, for instance Oribatida
   responded negatively to herbivores, whereas Collembola did not. Our
   findings imply that losses and gains of aboveground herbivores will
   interact with climate and land use changes, inducing functional shifts
   in soil communities. To conceptualize the mechanisms behind our findings
   and link them with previous theoretical frameworks, we propose two
   complementary approaches to predict soil biological responses to
   vertebrate herbivores, one focused on an herbivore body size gradient,
   and the other on a climate severity gradient. Major research gaps were
   revealed, with tropical biomes, protists, and soil macrofauna being
   especially overlooked.}},

Abstract = {{Non-consumptive effects (NCEs) - changes in prey behavior or physiology
   in response to predator threat - are common and can be as strong as
   consumptive effects. However, our knowledge of NCEs in arthropod systems
   is lacking. Factors related to study organism and environment have the
   potential to influence the occurrence and magnitude of NCEs in arthropod
   systems. While factors such as coevolutionary history of natural enemies
   and their prey, predator cue, predator or prey feeding mode, and refuge
   availability have been theoretically and empirically examined, no trends
   have been proposed for arthropods. We compiled 62 studies, yielding 128
   predator-prey interactions, which explicitly examined NCEs in
   experiments where arthropods were identified to species, using a
   previously published database of papers from 1990 to 2005 and a new
   database of papers published from 2006 to 2015. Using these data, we
   conducted a meta-analysis to explore the influence of organismal and
   environmental characteristics on the magnitude of predator NCEs. Our
   analysis addressed the following three questions. 1) Does predator-prey
   coevolution give rise to stronger NCEs than when predator and prey
   species did not coevolve? 2) What influence does habitat type and refuge
   availability have on NCEs? 3) How do predator characteristics (cue type,
   hunting mode and life stage) and prey characteristics (mobility, life
   stage, specialization, gregariousness and feeding mode) influence NCEs?
   We found that while NCEs were similar across most measured
   characteristics, NCEs on prey activity were significantly stronger when
   predator and prey shared an evolutionary history. Our results support
   growing evidence that NCEs have a negative effect on prey traits and
   that behavioral NCEs are stronger than physiological ones. Additional
   studies are needed to be confident in any emerging patterns, therefore
   we identify key gaps in the literature on NCEs in arthropod systems and
   discuss ideas for moving forward.}},

Abstract = {{Neophobia, the fear of novel stimuli, plays a major role in animal
   ecology. Here, we review studies on predator neophobia and explore its
   underlying patterns within an ecological framework. Predator neophobia
   is typically assessed by observing behaviours in novel areas that bring
   potential risk from unknown predators, or by observing behaviours
   towards certain kinds of objects and odours that are novel. We conducted
   a literature review across taxa, surveying research on baseline and
   induced neophobia versus controls. We calculated effect sizes for the
   intensity of neophobic responses, and categorized data according to six
   factors (taxa, age class, background type, trophic position, test cue
   type and experimental treatment type). While accounting for each of the
   other factors, we found that baseline neophobia was stronger among birds
   and mammals, and towards novel areas, relative to other taxa and cue
   types. Baseline neophobia was lower for wild-caught animals and for
   those that were higher in trophic position, compared with those reared
   in captivity and from lower trophic levels. By contrast, induced
   neophobia was similar in intensity across taxa, background types and
   testing cue types, while again being lower among upper trophic-level
   members and among juvenile animals. Although induced neophobia occurred
   across all treatment types, brain lesions induced stronger neophobia
   than predation risk or social isolation. We discuss potential mechanisms
   underlying these results and highlight gaps in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Concern about the impacts of invasive species on invaded communities is
   often linked to the expectation that invasive consumers will be more
   effective at using resources than native ones. Many invasive marine
   crabs (infraorder Brachyura) are regarded as particularly capable
   consumers; however, native crabs can also exert significant influence on
   community structure. We used marine crabs as a focal group to test
   whether non-native consumers have greater impacts than native consumers
   on native prey populations by conducting a systematic review and
   meta-analysis of 834 crab foraging experiments. In addition to the
   effect of crab origin (non-native or native) on prey abundance, we
   examined the effects of interaction type (direct or indirect), prey
   type, and experimental design. Overall, direct consumption by non-native
   crabs did not reduce prey abundance more than predation by native crabs,
   although the magnitude of reductions in prey abundance varied with prey
   type and experimental design. Indirect inter actions with crabs (i. e.
   through trophic cascades with crabs as the initiators) generally
   increased the abundance of native species. The direct and indirect
   impacts of non-native crabs were significantly greater than those of
   native crabs on primary producers and in simplified experiments with low
   species diversity. Thus, detecting differences between native and
   non-native crabs may be heavily influenced by experimental design.
   Importantly, we found few studies that considered direct interactions
   (competitive or predatory) between native and non-native crabs. These
   inter actions should be a focus of future research because they could
   greatly alter consumption rates and overall prey mortality in the wild.}},

Abstract = {{A classic topic in ecology and evolution, phenotypic microevolution of
   quantitative traits has received renewed attention in the face of rapid
   global environmental change. However, for plants, synthesis has been
   hampered by the limited use of standard metrics, which makes it
   difficult to systematize empirical information. Here we demonstrate the
   advantages of incorporating meta-analysis tools to the review of
   microevolutionary rates. We perform a systematic survey of the plant
   literature on microevolution of quantitative traits over known periods
   of time, based on the scopus database. We quantify the amount of change
   by standard mean difference and develop a set of effect sizes to analyze
   such data. We show that applying meta-analysis tools to a systematic
   literature review allows the extraction of a much larger volume of
   information than directly calculating microevolutionary rates. We also
   propose derived meta-analysis effect sizes (h, LG and LR) which are
   appropriate for the study of evolutionary patterns, the first being
   similar to haldanes, the second and third allowing the application of a
   preexisting analytical framework for the inference of evolutionary
   mechanisms. This novel methodological development is applicable to the
   study of microevolution in any taxa. To pilot test it, we built an
   open-access database of 1,711 microevolutionary rates of 152 angiosperm
   species from 128 studies documenting population changes in quantitative
   traits following an environmental novelty with a known elapsed time
   (<260years). The performance of the metrics proposed (h, LG and LR) is
   similar to that of preexisting ones, and at the same time they bring the
   advantages of lower estimation bias and higher number of usable
   observations typical of meta-analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Comprehensive knowledge of the effects of disturbances on biodiversity
   is crucial for conservation and management, not least because ecosystems
   with low biodiversity may be the most vulnerable. In rivers, the role of
   disturbance in shaping aquatic biodiversity has mainly focused on
   floods. Perennial rivers (PRs) often flood, whereas intermittent rivers
   (IRs) flood, stop flowing and dry. Despite the recent and significant
   increase in research on IRs, controversy remains about whether they are
   more or less biodiverse than PRs. Our aim was to determine (Q1) if PRs
   and IRs differ in biodiversity and (Q2) if the direction and magnitude
   of the differences (effect sizes) are related to environmental (climate,
   season, habitat, longitudinal zonation and anthropogenic disturbance)
   and/or biological factors (taxonomic group). We conducted a
   meta-analysis on 44 published studies of PR and IR biodiversity that had
   replicated data. We applied random effects models to the data to obtain
   weighted mean effect sizes for differences between PRs and IRs, and
   their confidence intervals, by first considering all studies and then by
   splitting studies into groups on the basis of the above factors. We
   found that biodiversity was significantly higher in PRs than in IRs
   (Q1). We also detected significant differences (PRs > IRs) in studies of
   macroinvertebrates, in those conducted within arid and temperate
   climates, dry and wet sampling seasons, headwaters, and regions subject
   to different levels of anthropogenic disturbance (Q2). Our meta-analysis
   suggests that the expected increase in the prevalence of IRs in certain
   regions of the world due to global change could result in a decrease in
   freshwater biodiversity. To better manage and preserve aquatic
   biodiversity under future global change scenarios and to avoid potential
   ecosystem consequences of biodiversity loss, conservation efforts should
   be targeted towards those environmental conditions or taxonomic groups
   with significant differences (PRs > IRs).}},

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can increase plant fitness under

   exchange for carbon from plant hosts. However, AMF may also provide a
   suite of non-nutritional benefits to plants including improved water

   and allelochemical transport and protection. Here, we use a
   meta-analysis of 93 studies to assess the relative effect of AMF on

   directions, including experimentally assessing the relative contribution

Abstract = {{Aim: Changes in global climate and land use are expected to alter water
   and nutrient availability. Various meta-analyses and large-scale
   experiments show that increasing nutrient availability is expected to
   decrease the diversity of ecological communities, but so far, no study
   has attempted to provide a global-scale perspective of diversity
   responses to water manipulation.
   Location: Global.
   Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis focusing on the effects of water
   and nutrient additions both on species richness and on biomass of
   herbaceous plant communities. We identified 41 water addition
   experiments, of which 19 experiments manipulated both water and
   nutrients.
   Results: Although both water and nutrient additions increased biomass
   (by c.15 and 34\%, respectively), only the latter consistently decreased
   richness (by c. 23\%). Biomass responses to water addition were mainly
   derived from an increase in forb biomass (by c. 37\%), whereas
   corresponding responses to nutrient addition were derived from an
   increase in graminoid biomass (by c. 56\%). Addition of both water and
   nutrients led to larger biomass responses compared with the addition of
   each resource alone (by c. 69\%), but the negative effect on species
   richness was similar to nitrogen addition alone. None of these responses
   could be explained by general (resource-independent) theories, such as
   the productivity-diversity hypothesis or the niche dimension hypothesis.
   Main conclusions: While highlighting overlooked patterns, this
   meta-analysis reveals a fundamental knowledge gap in our ability to
   predict biodiversity responses to global change and demonstrates that
   future theories attempting to explain and predict such changes must take
   into account the potential implications of resource-specific and

Abstract = {{1. Meta-analysis and meta-regression are statistical methods for
   synthesizing and modelling the results of different studies, and are
   critical research synthesis tools in ecology and evolutionary biology
   (E\&E). However, many E\&E researchers carry out meta-analyses using
   software that is limited in its statistical functionality and is not
   easily updatable. It is likely that these software limitations have
   slowed the uptake of new methods in E\&E and limited the scope and
   quality of inferences from research syntheses.
   2. We developed OpenMEE: Open Meta-analyst for Ecology and Evolution to
   address the need for advanced, easy-to-use software for meta-analysis
   and meta-regression. OpenMEE has a cross-platform, easy-to-use graphical
   user interface (GUI) that gives E\&E researchers access to the diverse
   and advanced statistical functionalities offered in R, without requiring
   knowledge of R programming.
   3. OpenMEE offers a suite of advanced meta-analysis and meta-regression
   methods for synthesizing continuous and categorical data, including
   meta-regression with multiple covariates and their interactions,
   phylogenetic analyses, and simple missing data imputation. OpenMEE also
   supports data importing and exporting, exploratory data analysis,
   graphing of data, and summary table generation.
   4. As intuitive, open-source, free software for advanced methods in
   meta-analysis, OpenMEE meets the current and pressing needs of the E\&E
   community for teaching meta-analysis and conducting high-quality
   syntheses. Because OpenMEE's statistical components are written in R,
   new methods and packages can be rapidly incorporated into the software.
   To fully realize the potential of OpenMEE, we encourage community
   development with an aim to advance the capabilities of meta-analyses in

Abstract = {{Many parasitoid species use olfactory cues to locate their hosts. In
   tritrophic systems, parasitoids of herbivores can exploit the chemical
   blends emitted by plants in reaction to herbivore-induced damage, known
   as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). In this study, we explored
   the specificity and innateness of parasitoid responses to HIPVs using a
   meta-analysis of data from the literature. Based on the concept of
   dietary specialization and infochemical use, we hypothesized that (i)
   specialist parasitoids (i.e.,with narrow host ranges) should be
   attracted to specific HIPV signals, whereas generalist parasitoids
   (i.e., with broad host ranges) should be attracted to more generic HIPV
   signals and (ii) specialist parasitoids should innately respond to
   HIPVs, whereas generalist parasitoids should have to learn to associate
   HIPVs with host presence. We characterized the responses of 66
   parasitoid species based on published studies of parasitoid behavior.
   Our meta-analysis showed that (i) as predicted, specialist parasitoids
   were attracted to more specific signals than were generalist parasitoids
   but, (ii) contrary to expectations, response innateness depended on a
   parasitoid's target host life stage rather than on its degree of host
   specialization: parasitoids of larvae were more likely to show an innate
   response to HIPVs than were parasitoids of adults. This result changes
   our understanding of dietary specialization and highlights the need for
   further theoretical research that will help clarify infochemical use by
   parasitoids.}},

   suitability and that environmental variables, scale, and type of model
   fitting can confound this relationship. We performed a meta-analysis to
   1) test whether species abundance is positively correlated with
   environmental suitability derived from correlative ecological niche
   models (ENM), 2) test whether studies encompassing large areas within a
   species range (> 50\%) exhibited higher AS correlations than studies
   encompassing small areas within a species range (< 50\%), 3) assess
   which modelling method provided higher AS correlation, and 4) compare
   strength of the AS relationship between studies using only climatic
   variables and those that used both climatic and other environmental
   variables to derive suitability. We used correlation coefficients to
   measure the relationship between abundance and environmental suitability
   derived from ENM. Each correlation coefficient was considered an effect
   size in a random-effects multivariate meta-analysis. In all cases we
   found a significantly positive relationship between abundance and
   suitability. This relationship was consistent regardless of scale of
   study, ENM method, or set of variables used to derive suitability. There
   was no difference in strength of correlation between studies focusing on
   large or small areas within a species' range or among ENM methods.
   Studies using other variables in combination with climate exhibited
   higher AS correlations than studies using only climatic variables. We
   conclude that occurrence data can be a reasonable proxy for abundance,
   especially for vertebrates, and the use of local variables increases the
   strength of the AS relationship. Use of ENMs can significantly decrease
   survey costs and allow the study of large-scale abundance patterns using
   less information. Including only climatic variables in ENM may confound
   the relationship between abundance and suitability when compared to
   studies including variables taken locally. However, modelers and
   conservationists must be aware that high environmental suitability does
   not always indicate high abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality during commercial fishing activities is a significant threat
   to many imperiled seabird species, and myriad technologies have been
   developed to reduce mortality during longline fishing operations.
   However, individual studies have never been combined in a quantitative
   manner to determine if seabird bycatch reduction devices (BRD) have a
   detrimental effect upon target species catch. We performed a
   meta-analysis of the longline fishery BRD literature to determine the
   general impact of BRD technology upon commercial fishing operations.
   There were relatively few papers with data suitable for a meta analysis
   (15), therefore we pooled studies in the analysis with BRD and fishery
   related metrics included as covariates. Overall, we found no reduction
   in target fish catch. In fact, we found an increase in target catch of
   9\% (95\% CI {[}1,17]) with BRD use. We show that this increase occurs
   while BRDs reduce seabird bycatch by 89\% (95\% CI {[}82,93]). These
   patterns do not change with respect to geographic location or BRD type,
   indicating that efforts to reduce seabird bycatch are generally
   effective under different conditions. Our review identifies research
   needed to ensure the generality of our findings and to better understand
   the impacts of BRD implementation upon seabird conservation and

Title = {{The effects of ant nests on soil fertility and plant performance: a
   meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{866-877}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Ants are recognized as one of the major sources of soil disturbance
   world-wide. However, this view is largely based on isolated studies and
   qualitative reviews. Here, for the first time, we quantitatively
   determined whether ant nests affect soil fertility and plant
   performance, and identified the possible sources of variation of these
   effects.
   2. Using Bayesian mixed-models meta-analysis, we tested the hypotheses
   that ant effects on soil fertility and plant performance depend on the
   substrate sampled, ant feeding type, latitude, habitat and the plant
   response variable measured.
   3. Ant nests showed higher nutrient and cation content than adjacent
   non-nest soil samples, but similar pH. Nutrient content was higher in
   ant refuse materials than in nest soils. The fertilizer effect of ant
   nests was also higher in dry habitats than in grasslands or savannas.
   Cation content was higher in nests of plant-feeding ants than in nests
   of omnivorous species, and lower in nests from agro-ecosystems than in
   nests from any other habitat.
   4. Plants showed higher green/root biomass and fitness on ant nests
   soils than in adjacent, non-nest sites; but plant density and diversity
   were unaffected by the presence of ant nests. Root growth was
   particularly higher in refuse materials than in ant nest soils, in
   leaf-cutting ant nests and in deserts habitats.
   5. Our results confirm the major role of ant nests in influencing soil
   fertility and vegetation patterns and provide information about the
   factors that mediate these effects. First, ant nests improve soil
   fertility mainly through the accumulation of refuse materials. Thus,
   different refuse dump locations (external or in underground nest
   chambers) could benefit different vegetation life-forms. Second, ant
   nests could increase plant diversity at larger spatial scales only if
   the identity of favoured plants changes along environmental gradients
   (i.e. enhancing beta-diversity). Third, ant species that feed on plants
   play a relevant role fertilizing soils, which may balance their known
   influence as primary consumers. Fourth, the effects of ant nests as
   fertility islands are larger in arid lands, possibly because fertility
   is intrinsically lower in these habitats. Overall, this study provide
   novel and quantitative evidence confirming that ant nests are key soil
   modifiers, emphasizing their role as ecological engineers.}},

Abstract = {{1. Ecological and evolutionary research increasingly uses quantitative
   synthesis of primary research studies (meta-analysis) for answering
   fundamental questions, informing environmental policy and summarizing
   results for decision makers.
   2. Knowing how meta-analysis works is important for researchers so that
   their research can have broader impact. Meta-analytic thinking
   encourages scientists to see single primary research studies as
   substantial contributions to a larger picture.
   3. To facilitate inclusion in a meta-analysis, relevant primary research
   studies must be found and basic information about the methods and
   results must be thoroughly, clearly and transparently reported. While
   many published papers provide this information, it is common for
   essential data to be omitted, leading to study exclusion from
   meta-analyses.
   4. We provide guidelines for correctly reporting basic data needed from
   primary studies in ecology and evolutionary biology so that they can be
   included in meta-analyses, together with examples that show how data
   should be reported to enable calculation and analysis of effect sizes,
   and how data should be made accessible.
   5. These guidelines are important for reporting research results in
   general, whether or not results are included in subsequent
   meta-analyses, because they are necessary for the interpretation and
   assessment of study outcomes. Increased implementation of these
   guidelines by authors, editors and publishers, and reinforcement by

Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{772-781}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In marine mammals such as pinnipeds (seals, sea lions and walruses),
   reproductive strategies reveal how species acquire, store and allocate
   energy to offspring. During lactation, females can allocate energy
   acquired from concurrent resources (income breeding); or utilize energy
   stored prior to reproduction (capital breeding). Mothers transfer a
   large proportion of energy to their pups via lipid rich milk, meaning
   that pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury
   (Hg) will also transfer, raising concern for negative health effects. To
   quantify the effect of reproductive strategy on maternal pollutant
   transfer in pinnipeds, we developed a proxy for income and capital
   breeding by focusing on the lactational component of reproduction, and
   arranged species along this gradient. We found a strong positive
   relationship between lipid content in milk and degree of capital
   breeding. We tested this gradient against maternal pollutant transfer
   expressed as a concentration ratio by meta-analysis. In mother-pup
   pairs, the concentration ratio of PCBs was one order of magnitude higher
   than for mercury. PCB concentrations in pups and juveniles were similar
   to adult females, but mercury was always lower in young offspring than
   in females. We found no effect of reproductive strategy between studies
   investigating mother-pup pairs and non-related females and juveniles (<
   1 year old), however data were strongly biased towards capital breeders.
   Our results suggest that either: 1) reproductive strategy does not
   affect pollutant bioaccumulation; or 2) a lack of income breeder data
   prevents us from testing the overall effect of reproductive strategy on
   maternal pollutant transfer. The finding that PCB concentrations in
   juveniles are similar to females is of concern due to early life stage
   exposure. We recommend data collection from income breeding species such
   as the sea lions to elucidate whether reproductive strategy, and
   potentially other life history traits, has an overall effect on maternal
   pollutant transfer.}},

   Overcoming the defects of profiling analyses caused by heterogeneity of

   this research, a literature-searching strategy was used to identify salt

   PubMed database, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and the
   ArrayExpress database. Twenty-five studies were filtered from the 2161,
   121, and 700 identified studies. A rank aggregation method (RRA)- based
   meta-analysis were conducted to synthesize the 25 profiling datasets and
   identified 829 dysregulated genes with 452 up-regulated and 377
   down-regulated in NaCl-treated samples. Gene ontology enrichment and
   pathway analyses classified the 452 up-regulated genes into functional
   categories involved ``response to plant hormone and compounds,''
   ``signaling'' and ``developmental plasticity,'' etc. In total, 111
   dysregulated transcription factors (TFs) were further identified and 387
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predicted as these TFs'
   targets. The identification of transcriptional factors, functional
   repertoire, and biological pathways response to the salt stress signal
   would promote mechanistic studies underlying stress tolerance process in

   abilities of various plants during the evolution of plant kingdom.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of experimental drought manipulation
   studies using rainout shelters in five sites of natural grassland
   ecosystems of Europe. The single studies assess the effects of extreme
   drought on the intraspecific variation of the specific leaf area (SLA),
   a proxy of plant growth. We evaluate and compare the effect size of the
   SLA response for the functional groups of forbs and grasses in temperate
   and sub-Mediterranean systems. We hypothesized that the functional
   groups of grasses and forbs from temperate grassland systems have
   different strategies in short-term drought response, measured as
   adjustment of SLA, with SLA-reduction in grasses and SLA-maintenance in
   forbs. Second, we hypothesized that grasses and forbs from
   sub-Mediterranean systems do not differ in their drought response as
   both groups maintain their SLA. We found a significant decrease of SLA
   in grasses of the temperate systems in response to drought while SLA of
   forbs showed no significant response. Lower SLA is associated with
   enhanced water-use efficiency under water stress and thus can be seen as
   a strategy of phenotypic adjustment. By contrast, in the
   sub-Mediterranean systems, grasses significantly increased their SLA in
   the drought treatment. This result points towards a better growth
   performance of these grasses, which is most likely related to their
   strategy to allocate resources to belowground parts. The observed SLA
   reduction of forbs is most likely a direct drought response given that
   competitive effect of grasses is unlikely due to the scanty vegetation
   cover. We point out that phenotypic adjustment is an important driver of
   short-term functional plant response to climatic extremes such as
   drought. Differential reactions of functional groups have to be
   interpreted against the background of the group's evolutionary
   configuration that can differ between climatic zones.}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Anthropogenic additions of nitrogen (N) are expected to drive
   terrestrial ecosystems toward greater phosphorus (P) limitation.
   However, a comprehensive understanding of how an ecosystem's P cycle
   responds to external N inputs remains elusive, making model predictions
   of the anthropogenic P limitation and its impacts largely uncertain.
   Location: Global.
   Time period: 1986-2015.
   Major taxa studied: Terrestrial ecosystems.
   Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis including 288 independent study
   sites from 192 articles to evaluate global patterns and controls of 10
   variables associated with ecosystem P cycling under N addition.
   Results: Overall, N addition increased biomass in plants (134\%) and
   litter (115\%) as well as plant P content (117\%), while decreasing P
   concentrations in plants and litter (28\% and 211\%, respectively). N
   addition did not change soil labile P or microbial P, but enhanced
   phosphatase activity (124\%). The effects of N addition on the litter P
   pool and soil total P remained unclear due to significant publication
   biases. The response of P cycling to N addition in tropical forests was
   different from that in other ecosystem types. N addition did not change
   plant biomass or phosphatase activity in tropical forests but
   significantly reduced plant P and soil labile P concentrations. The
   shift in plant P concentration under N addition was negatively
   correlated with the N application rate or total N load. N-induced change
   in soil labile P was strongly regulated by soil pH value at the control
   sites, with a significant decrease of 14\% only in acidic soils (pH <
   5.5).
   Main conclusions: Our results suggest that as anthropogenic N
   enhancement continues in the future it could induce P limitation in
   terrestrial ecosystems while accelerating P cycling, particularly in
   tropical forests. A quantitative framework generated on the basis of
   this meta-analysis is useful for our understanding of ecosystem P
   cycling with N addition, and for incorporating the anthropogenic P
   limitation into ecosystem models used to analyse effects of future
   climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Streams are reliant on streamside plants for allochthonous inputs that
   form the base of the stream food web. The impact of exotic leaves on
   stream ecosystems has been investigated regionally, but not assessed
   globally. In this study, we conducted a global meta-analysis contrasting
   native and exotic aquatic litter decay. We used a linear mixed effects
   model to identify how the site-specific factors and experimental
   treatments of latitude, temperature, pH, conductivity and the exclusion
   of invertebrates (via mesh size) cause relative differences in exotic
   and native decay rates. Subsequently, we assessed whether differences in
   native and exotic litter decay rates were driven by the intrinsic
   factors of leaf litter quality. We found that overall leaf litter decay
   rates were similar for native and exotic leaves on a global scale.
   However, we also found that exotic leaves decayed faster than native
   leaves at higher stream temperatures and in larger mesh sizes (allowing
   macroinvertebrate access); yet, those differences disappeared at lower
   temperatures and in finer mesh sizes which excluded macroinvertebrates.
   Post hoc analysis of leaf quality suggested that differences between
   higher native and lower exotic leaf C:N ratios might explain differences
   in decomposition rates observed at high temperature, and differences
   between lower native and higher exotic leaf C:P ratios associated with
   differences in decomposition rates observed at coarse mesh sizes. Our
   study suggests that exotic leaf litter is likely to have the most impact
   in high-temperature stream ecosystems and that the nature of the impact
   is potentially related to the C:N ratio differences between native and
   exotic leaves. This might indicate that higher temperature stream
   ecosystems are more vulnerable to changes in litter decay rates due to
   invasion by exotic plant species than lower temperature stream
   ecosystems, and should be monitored accordingly. We recommend that
   future leaf litter decay studies include stream discharge measurements
   and leaf litter quality information so that both intrinsic and extrinsic
   factors that impact litter decay can be fully accounted for when
   assessing the factors that drive differences in leaf litter decay rates.}},

Abstract = {{Soils are among the important sources of atmospheric nitric oxide (NO)

   varieties, ammonium nitrate had the greatest EFNO (2.93\%) and EFc
   (5.97\%). Some options such as organic instead of synthetic N
   fertilizer, decreasing N fertilizer input rate, nitrification inhibitor

Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{126-135}},

Abstract = {{Although several factors contribute to low rates of access to improved
   water and sanitation in the developing world, it is especially important
   to understand and measure household demand for these services. One
   valuable source of information regarding demand is the growing empirical
   literature that has applied stated preference methods to estimate
   households' willingness to pay (WTP). Because it is difficult to
   generalize and support planning based on this scattered literature, we
   conduct a meta-analysis to take stock of the worldwide sample of
   household WTP for improved drinking water services. Using 171 WTP
   estimates drawn from 60 studies, we first describe this sample and then
   examine the potential factors that explain variation in WTP estimates.
   Our results suggest that households are willing to pay between
   approximately \$3 and \$30 per month for improvements in water access.
   Specifically, in line with economic theory and intuition, WTP is
   sensitive to scope (the magnitude of improvement in drinking water
   services), as well as household income, and stated-preference
   elicitation method. We demonstrate how our results can be used to
   predict household-level WTP for selected improvements in drinking water
   access in regions with low coverage, and find that private benefits
   exceed the cost of provision. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Adaptive evolutionary responses are determined by the strength of
   selection and amount of genetic variation within traits, however, both
   are known to vary across environmental conditions. As selection is
   generally expected to be strongest under stressful conditions,
   understanding how the expression of genetic variation changes across
   stressful and benign environmental conditions is crucial for predicting
   the rate of adaptive change. Although theory generally predicts
   increased genetic variation under stress, previous syntheses of the
   field have found limited support for this notion. These studies have
   focused on heritability, which is dependent on other environmentally
   sensitive, but nongenetic, sources of variation. Here, we aim to
   complement these studies with a meta-analysis in which we examine
   changes in coefficient of variation (CV) in maternal, genetic, and
   residual variances across stressful and benign conditions. Confirming
   previous analyses, we did not find any clear direction in how
   heritability changes across stressful and benign conditions. However,
   when analyzing CV, we found higher genetic and residual variance under
   highly stressful conditions in life-history traits but not in
   morphological traits. Our findings are of broad significance to
   contemporary evolution suggesting that rapid evolutionary adaptive
   response may be mediated by increased evolutionary potential in stressed
   populations.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{226-239}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Winter cover crops (WCCs) provide agronomic and environmental benefits,
   although their impacts on subsequent crop yields have been reported to
   vary across regions, soils, or under different farm practices. To
   address the variability in response, previous qualitative and
   quantitative reviews have summarized the overall yield effects of WCCs.
   However, the results from such reviews need constant revision as new
   research is published and interest in the conservation benefits of WCCs
   increases. Here, we update a previous meta-analysis of WCC effects on
   corn (Zea mays) yields, which summarized peer-reviewed research from the
   United Sates and Canada that was published between 1965 and 2004. Our
   updated data set (1965 to 2015) comprises 268 observations from 65
   studies conducted in different regions of the United States and Canada,
   and includes information about the management practices utilized (i.e.,
   WCC species, nitrogen {[}N] fertilization, termination date, tillage,
   etc.). The effect-size was the response ratio (RR), defined as corn
   yield following WCCs relative to yield after no cover crop (NC). As in
   the previous meta-analysis, our results showed a neutral to positive
   contribution of WCCs to corn yields. On average, grass WCCs neither
   increased nor decreased corn yields, although corn grown for grain
   yielded relatively higher than silage corn after grass WCCs. Legume WCCs
   resulted in subsequent higher corn yields by 30\% to 33\% when N
   fertilizer rates were low or the tillage system shifted from
   conventional tillage (CT) to no-tillage (NT). Mixture WCCs increased
   corn yields by 30\% when the cover crop was late terminated (zero to six
   days before subsequent corn). Evidence of 65 years of research showed
   that uncertainty around the RR has decreased and corn yield response to
   WCCs has stabilized over time. Our results suggest that benefits of WCCs
   do not result in reduced corn productivity if properly managed.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1861-1870}},

Abstract = {{Ecologists have recently devoted their attention to the study of species
   traits and their role in the establishment and spread of nonindigenous
   species (NIS). However, research efforts have mostly focused on studies
   of terrestrial taxa, with lesser attention being dedicated to aquatic
   species. Aquatic habitats comprise of interconnected waterways, as well
   as exclusive introduction vectors that allow unparalleled artificial
   transport of species and their propagules. Consequently, species traits
   that commonly facilitate biological invasions in terrestrial systems may
   not be as represented in aquatic environments. We provide a global
   meta-analysis of studies conducted in both marine and freshwater
   habitats. We selected studies that conducted experiments with native and
   NIS under common environmental conditions to allow detailed comparisons
   among species traits. In addition, we explored whether different factors
   such as species relatedness, functional feeding groups, latitude,
   climate, and experimental conditions could be linked to predictive
   traits. Our results show that species with traits that enhance
   consumption and growth have a substantially increased probability of
   establishing and spreading when entering novel ecosystems. Moreover,
   traits associated with predatory avoidance were more prevalent in NIS
   and therefore favour invasive species in aquatic habitats. When we
   analysed NIS interacting with taxonomically distinctive native taxa, we
   found that consumption and growth were particularly important traits.
   This suggests that particular attention should be paid to newly
   introduced species for which there are no close relatives in the local
   biota. Finally, we found a bias towards studies conducted in temperate
   regions, and thus, more studies in other climatic regions are needed. We
   conclude that studies aiming at predicting future range shifts should
   consider trophic traits of aquatic NIS as these traits are indicative of
   multiple interacting mechanisms involved in promoting species invasions.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge-based nitrogen (N) management, which is designed for a better
   synchronization of crop N demand with N supply, is critical for global
   food security and environmental sustainability. Yet, a comprehensive
   assessment on how these N management practices affect food production,
   greenhouse gas emission (GHG), and N pollution in China is lacking. We
   compiled the results of 376 studies (1166 observations) to evaluate the
   overall effects of seven knowledge-based N management practices on crop
   productivity, nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, and major reactive N (Nr)
   losses (ammonia, NH3; N leaching and runoff), for staple grain (rice,
   wheat, and corn) production in China. These practices included the
   application of controlled-release N fertilizer, nitrification inhibitor
   (NI) and urease inhibitor (UI), higher splitting frequency of fertilizer
   N application, lower basal N fertilizer (BF) proportion, deep placement
   of N fertilizer, and optimal N rate based on soil N test. Our results
   showed that, compared to traditional N management, these knowledge-based
   N practices significantly increased grain yields by 1.3-10.0\%, which is
   attributed to the higher aboveground N uptake (5.1-12.1\%) and N use
   efficiency in grain (8.0-48.2\%). Moreover, these N management practices
   overall reduced GHG emission and Nr losses, by 5.4-39.8\% for N2O
   emission, 30.7-61.5\% for NH3 emission (except for the NI application),
   13.6-37.3\% for N leaching, and 15.5-45.0\% for N runoff. The use of NI
   increased NH3 emission by 27.5\% (9.0-56.0\%), which deserves
   extra-attention. The cost and benefit analysis indicated that the yield
   profit of these N management practices exceeded the corresponding input
   cost, which resulted in a significant increase of the net economic
   benefit by 2.9-12.6\%. These results suggest that knowledge-based N
   management practice can be considered an effective way to ensure food
   security and improve environmental sustainability, while increasing
   economic return.}},

Abstract = {{Meta-analysis is an important tool for synthesizing research on a
   variety of topics in ecology and evolution, including molecular ecology,
   but can be susceptible to nonindependence. Nonindependence can affect
   two major interrelated components of a meta-analysis: (i) the
   calculation of effect size statistics and (ii) the estimation of overall
   meta-analytic estimates and their uncertainty. While some solutions to
   nonindependence exist at the statistical analysis stages, there is
   little advice on what to do when complex analyses are not possible, or
   when studies with nonindependent experimental designs exist in the data.
   Here we argue that exploring the effects of procedural decisions in a
   meta-analysis (e.g. inclusion of different quality data, choice of
   effect size) and statistical assumptions (e.g. assuming no phylogenetic
   covariance) using sensitivity analyses are extremely important in
   assessing the impact of nonindependence. Sensitivity analyses can
   provide greater confidence in results and highlight important
   limitations of empirical work (e.g. impact of study design on overall
   effects). Despite their importance, sensitivity analyses are seldom
   applied to problems of nonindependence. To encourage better practice for
   dealing with nonindependence in meta-analytic studies, we present
   accessible examples demonstrating the impact that ignoring
   nonindependence can have on meta-analytic estimates. We also provide
   pragmatic solutions for dealing with nonindependent study designs, and
   for analysing dependent effect sizes. Additionally, we offer reporting
   guidelines that will facilitate disclosure of the sources of
   nonindependence in meta-analyses, leading to greater transparency and
   more robust conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Stratospheric ozone depletion and simultaneous increases in UVB
   radiation due to human activities have the potential to affect
   freshwater biota. The goal of our study is to summarize the impacts of
   UVB on freshwater biota by comparing the differences in the general
   patterns, including the directions and the magnitudes of the impacts of
   UVB on four major freshwater taxa (phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish and
   amphibians). The potential driving forces for these differences are also
   explored.
   Location Global.
   Methods We performed a meta-analysis on a database consisting of 146
   studies including 127 species from four taxonomic groups. We tested for
   the effects of taxonomic group, experimental venue, developmental stage,
   UVB dosage and the latitude of organism provenance.
   Results UVB had significant negative effects on freshwater biota from
   the molecular-cellular to individual-population levels. However, these
   effects were highly variable among the taxonomic groups. In general,
   zooplankton was the most negatively affected group, whereas fish and
   amphibians were less affected. As direct fitness components, survival
   and reproduction were the two responses most affected by UVB. The
   sensitivities of individuals to UVB at different developmental stages
   were different for the same taxon, while the stage-dependent sensitivity
   patterns also differed among different taxa. Additionally, effects of
   different experimental venues, UVB dosages and latitudes of organism
   provenance on the effects of UVB were detected.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that UVB has significant negative
   effects on freshwater biota. We found that the effects of UVB varied
   among taxonomic groups, developmental stages, experimental venues, UVB
   dosages and latitudes of organism provenance. The variation in
   sensitivity among the different taxa has important implications for
   ecosystem responses. Given that stratospheric ozone is unlikely to
   recover to the levels of the 1980s in the upcoming decades, more
   conservation efforts should be taken to protect freshwater habitats from
   further damage by UVB.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental decision in biodiversity assessment is the selection of
   one or more study taxa, a choice that is often made using qualitative
   criteria such as historical precedent, ease of detection, or available
   technical or taxonomic expertise. A more robust approach would involve
   selecting taxa based on the a priori expectation that they will provide
   the best possible information on unmeasured groups, but data to inform
   such hypotheses are often lacking. Using a global meta-analysis, we
   quantified the proportion of variability that each of 12 taxonomic
   groups (at the Order level or above) explained in the richness or
   composition of other taxa. We then applied optimization to matrices of
   pairwise congruency to identify the best set of complementary surrogate
   groups. We found that no single taxon was an optimal surrogate for both
   the richness and composition of unmeasured taxa if we used simple
   methods to aggregate congruence data between studies. In contrast,
   statistical methods that accounted for well-known drivers of cross-taxon
   congruence (spatial extent, grain size, and latitude) lead to the
   prioritization of similar surrogates for both species richness and
   composition. Advanced statistical methods were also more effective at
   describing known ecological relationships between taxa than simple
   methods, and show that congruence is typically highest between
   taxonomically and functionally dissimilar taxa. Birds and vascular
   plants were most frequently selected by our algorithm as surrogates for
   other taxonomic groups, but the extent to which any one taxon was the
   `optimal' choice of surrogate for other biodiversity was highly
   context-dependent. In the absence of other information such as in
   data-poor areas of the globe, and under limited budgets for monitoring

Title = {{Do trout respond to riparian change? A meta-analysis with implications
   for restoration and management}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{445-457}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. There are strong conceptual links between riparian zones and
   freshwater fish via riparian influences on water quality, habitat
   quality and availability, and trophic dynamics. Many of the world's
   riparian zones are, however, severely degraded, and the key functions
   they provide for fish are lost or compromised. In response to their
   ongoing degradation, extensive works are underway globally to restore
   the structure and function of riparian zones. Despite intense effort, we
   lack clear empirical evidence of how fishes respond to changes in
   riparian zones.
   2. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore how
   trout ( specifically brook, brown, cutthroat, rainbow and steelhead),
   fish with globally important social, cultural, economic and ecological
   value, respond to key drivers of riparian alteration. We also identified
   where and with which species current research is being undertaken and
   examined the broad characteristics of different studies (e.g. location,
   focal species, length of study, study design) to better understand
   potential knowledge gaps in our understanding of how trout respond to
   changes in riparian zones.
   3. ISI Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for relevant
   peer-reviewed studies, and from an initial 6514 papers, 55 were included
   in the formal meta-analysis. From these, we extracted data to calculate
   response ratios comparing biological attributes at sites with altered
   riparian characteristics to suitable unmanipulated control sites. We
   used linear mixed effects models to assess general and species-specific
   trout responses to eight key `drivers' of change in riparian condition.
   4. Most studies were undertaken in North America using control-impact
   designs. We found little evidence for species-specific responses to
   riparian change, and surprisingly, many drivers deemed important in the
   literature (e.g. revegetation, managed canopy removal, grazing, and
   forestry clearing) did not consistently influence trout population-or
   individual-level metrics. Nonetheless, trout populations did respond
   positively to increasing woody debris and livestock exclusion (+87.7 and
   +66.6\% respectively), and negatively to bushfire and afforestation
   (-67.4 and -88.2\% respectively). We found some evidence that positive
   riparian changes may just attract fish (i.e. increased abundance or
   density) rather than enhance actual population production (i.e.
   individual size and growth). While this conclusion necessarily needs to
   be interpreted with caution, it does suggest that targeted research on
   the `production versus attraction' hypothesis would be beneficial.
   5. Several key drivers of riparian change, such as revegetation
   activities, have been the focus of only limited research. More
   generally, long-term data are lacking for most drivers. Both of these
   key information gaps limit our ability to predict the likely timing and
   trajectory of responses to riparian management. Robust monitoring
   programmes in areas with altered riparian zones - particularly using
   BACI designs to allow changes to be attributed to management - are
   required. The knowledge gaps present for fishes as ecologically,
   socially and environmentally important as trout are likely to be even
   more pronounced for the majority of less-studied freshwater fish
   species.}},

Title = {{Species diversity can be overestimated by a fixed empirical threshold:

Abstract = {{The use of genetic distances to identify species within the framework of
   DNA barcoding has to some extent improved the development of
   biodiversity studies. However, using a fixed empirical threshold to
   delimit species may lead to overestimating species diversity. In this
   study, we use a new data set of COI sequences for 366 specimens within
   the genus of Cletus as well as conduct an analysis on the same genetic
   data for collected morphologically defined species from previous
   phylogeographical studies, to test whether high intraspecific genetic
   divergences are common with the premises of comprehensive sampling. The
   results indicate C. graminis Hsiao \& Cheng 1964, is the same species
   with C. punctiger (Dallas, 1852) and should be synonymized and that the
   distributional record of C. pugnator (Fabricius, 1787) in China is
   correct. High intraspecific genetic differentiations (0\%-4.35\%) were
   found in C. punctiger. Furthermore, as to the mined data, the maximum
   intraspecific K2P distances of 186 species (48.44\% of 384) exceed 3\%,
   and 101 species (26.30\%) can be divided into two or more clusters with
   a threshold of 3\% in cluster analysis. If genetic distance is used to
   delimit species boundaries, the minimum interspecific K2P distance of
   the congeneric species should be considered rather than only using the
   fixed empirical value; otherwise, the species richness may be
   overestimated in some cases.}},

Title = {{Metabolic rates, and not hormone levels, are a likely mediator of

Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in hormone levels and metabolic rates
   have been proposed to be potential state variables underlying consistent
   individual differences in behaviour (i.e. animal personality). However,
   it remains unclear whether either one alone or both of these potential
   state variables could be an underlying driver of animal personality. We
   address this question using meta-analyses of published data from bird
   species. We hypothesized that state variables that mediate individual
   differences in behaviour would display similar or higher repeatability
   estimates than behavioural traits. To test this hypothesis, we
   quantified repeatability estimates of hormone levels, metabolic rates
   and behavioural traits. We found moderate to high mean repeatability
   estimates for both metabolic rates and behavioural traits, but low
   repeatability estimates for hormone levels. These findings indicate that
   metabolic rates likely represent an important mechanism for generating
   adaptive personality differences in behaviour. We also show that: (i)
   for hormones and behaviour, repeatability decreased with increasing
   interval time between two measurements; (ii) males and females differed
   in repeatability for behavioural traits; (iii) stress-induced hormone
   levels were more repeatable than baseline levels. Future studies are now
   required to determine the direction of the association between metabolic
   rates and behavioural traits. At the same time, these studies should try
   to investigate which of the proposed mechanisms is responsible for the
   relationship between state variable and state-dependent behaviour. In
   addition, we encourage researchers to report the coefficient of
   variation for between-individual variance (CVB) along with repeatability
   estimates because these two indices carry different information. We
   discuss how CVB may better facilitate future comparative studies,
   including meta-analyses.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in ecology, conservation and global-change biology is
   to understand why biodiversity responds differently to similar
   environmental changes. Contingent biodiversity responses may depend on
   how disturbance and dispersal interact to alter variation in community
   composition (-diversity) and assembly mechanisms. However, quantitative
   syntheses of these patterns and processes across studies are lacking.
   Using null-models and meta-analyses of 22 factorial experiments in
   herbaceous plant communities across Europe and North America, we show
   that disturbance diversifies communities when dispersal is limited, but
   homogenises communities when combined with increased immigration from
   the species pool. In contrast to the hypothesis that disturbance and
   dispersal mediate the strength of niche assembly, both processes altered
   -diversity through neutral-sampling effects on numbers of individuals
   and species in communities. Our synthesis suggests that stochastic
   effects of disturbance and dispersal on community assembly play an
   important, but underappreciated, role in mediating biotic homogenisation
   and biodiversity responses to environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Policymakers and advocates often use benefit transfers to estimate the
   economic value of environmental amenities when primary valuation studies

   studies of similar underlying amenities, generally outperform
   traditional site-to-site transfers. We build on earlier meta-analyses of

   meta-regression model with threshold effects, with a goal of increasing
   transfer reliability. We estimate a threshold in coral reef quality and
   find that increases in live coral cover have a large impact on
   individuals' WTP for recreation at degraded coral reefs. Relaxing the
   assumption of users' constant valuation across the distribution of this
   characteristic improves the performance of coral reef benefit transfers
   in some instances: tests of convergent validity reveal that including

Abstract = {{Globally, biological invasions can have strong impacts on biodiversity

   aboveground organisms, introduced belowground organisms may have
   similarly strong effects. Here, we synthesize for the first time the
   impacts of introduced earthworms on plant diversity and community
   composition in North American forests. We conducted a meta-analysis
   using a total of 645 observations to quantify mean effect sizes of
   associations between introduced earthworm communities and plant
   diversity, cover of plant functional groups, and cover of native and
   non-native plants. We found that plant diversity significantly declined

   While plant species richness or evenness did not change with earthworm
   invasion, our results indicate clear changes in plant community
   composition: cover of graminoids and non-native plant species
   significantly increased, and cover of native plant species (of all
   functional groups) tended to decrease, with increasing earthworm
   biomass. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that introduced
   earthworms facilitate particular plant species adapted to the abiotic
   conditions of earthworm-invaded forests. Further, our study provides

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing activities potentially alter ecosystem carbon (C) and

   numerous individual studies and a few meta-analyses had been conducted,
   how grazing, especially its intensity, affects belowground C and N
   cycling in grasslands remains unclear. In this study, we performed a
   comprehensive meta-analysis of 115 published studies to examine the
   responses of 19 variables associated with belowground C and N cycling to
   livestock grazing in global grasslands. Our results showed that, on
   average, grazing significantly decreased belowground C and N pools in
   grassland ecosystems, with the largest decreases in microbial biomass C
   and N (21.62\% and 24.40\%, respectively). In contrast, belowground
   fluxes, including soil respiration, soil net N mineralization and soil N
   nitrification increased by 4.25\%, 34.67\% and 25.87\%, respectively, in
   grazed grasslands compared to ungrazed ones. More importantly, grazing
   intensity significantly affected the magnitude (even direction) of
   changes in the majority of the assessed belowground C and N pools and
   fluxes, and C : N ratio as well as soil moisture. Specifically, light
   grazing contributed to soil C and N sequestration whereas moderate and
   heavy grazing significantly increased C and N losses. In addition, soil
   depth, livestock type and climatic conditions influenced the responses
   of selected variables to livestock grazing to some degree. Our findings
   highlight the importance of the effects of grazing intensity on
   belowground C and N cycling, which may need to be incorporated into
   regional and global models for predicting effects of human disturbance

Abstract = {{Wetlands play an important role in regulating the atmospheric carbon
   dioxide (CO2) concentrations and thus affecting the climate. However,
   there is still lack of quantitative evaluation of such a role across
   different wetland types, especially at the global scale. Here, we
   conducted a meta-analysis to compare ecosystem CO2 fluxes among various
   types of wetlands using a global database compiled from the literature.
   This database consists of 143 site-years of eddy covariance data from 22
   inland wetland and 21 coastal wetland sites across the globe. Coastal
   wetlands had higher annual gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem
   respiration (Re), and net ecosystem productivity (NEP) than inland
   wetlands. On a per unit area basis, coastal wetlands provided large CO2
   sinks, while inland wetlands provided small CO2 sinks or were nearly CO2
   neutral. The annual CO2 sink strength was 93.15 and 208.37 g C m(-2) for
   inland and coastal wetlands, respectively. Annual CO2 fluxes were mainly
   regulated by mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation
   (MAP). For coastal and inland wetlands combined, MAT and MAP explained
   71\%, 54\%, and 57\% of the variations in GPP, Re, and NEP,
   respectively. The CO2 fluxes of wetlands were also related to leaf area
   index (LAI). The CO2 fluxes also varied with water table depth (WTD),
   although the effects of WTD were not statistically significant. NEP was
   jointly determined by GPP and Re for both inland and coastal wetlands.
   However, the NEP/Re and NEP/GPP ratios exhibited little variability for
   inland wetlands and decreased for coastal wetlands with increasing
   latitude. The contrasting of CO2 fluxes between inland and coastal
   wetlands globally can improve our understanding of the roles of wetlands
   in the global C cycle. Our results also have implications for informing
   wetland management and climate change policymaking, for example, the
   efforts being made by international organizations and enterprises to
   restore coastal wetlands for enhancing blue carbon sinks.}},

Abstract = {{Salinity intrusion caused by land subsidence resulting from increasing
   groundwater abstraction, decreasing river sediment loads and increasing
   sea level because of climate change has caused widespread soil
   salinization in coastal ecosystems. Soil salinization may greatly alter
   nitrogen (N) cycling in coastal ecosystems. However, a comprehensive
   understanding of the effects of soil salinization on ecosystem N pools,
   cycling processes and fluxes is not available for coastal ecosystems.
   Therefore, we compiled data from 551 observations from 21 peer-reviewed
   papers and conducted a meta- analysis of experimental soil salinization
   effects on 19 variables related to N pools, cycling processes and fluxes
   in coastal ecosystems. Our results showed that the effects of soil
   salinization varied across different ecosystem types and salinity
   levels. Soil salinization increased plant N content (18\%), soil NH4+
   (12\%) and soil total N (210\%), although it decreased soil NO3- (2\%)
   and soil microbial biomass N (74\%). Increasing soil salinity stimulated
   soil N2O fluxes as well as hydrological NH4+ and NO2- fluxes more than
   threefold, although it decreased the hydrological dissolved organic
   nitrogen (DON) flux (59\%). Soil salinization also increased the net N
   mineralization by 70\%, although salinization effects were not observed
   on the net nitrification, denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate
   reduction to ammonium in this meta-analysis. Overall, this meta-analysis
   improves our understanding of the responses of ecosystem N cycling to
   soil salinization, identifies knowledge gaps and highlights the urgent
   need for studies on the effects of soil salinization on coastal
   agro-ecosystem and microbial N immobilization. Additional increases in
   knowledge are critical for designing sustainable adaptation measures to
   the predicted intrusion of salinity intrusion so that the productivity
   of coastal agro-ecosystems can be maintained or improved and the N
   losses and pollution of the natural environment can be minimized.}},

Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{1. There are wide reports of advances in the timing of spring migration
   of birds over time and in relation to rising temperatures, though
   phenological responses vary substantially within and among species. An
   understanding of the ecological, life-history and geographic variables
   that predict this intra-and interspecific variation can guide our
   projections of how populations and species are likely to respond to
   future climate change.
   2. Here, we conduct phylogenetic meta-analyses addressing slope
   estimates of the timing of avian spring migration regressed on (i) year
   and (ii) temperature, representing a total of 413 species across five
   continents. We take into account slope estimation error and examine
   phylogenetic, ecological and geographic predictors of intra-and
   interspecific variation.
   3. We confirm earlier findings that on average birds have significantly
   advanced their spring migration time by 2.1 days per decade and 1.2 days
   degrees C-1. We find that over time and in response to warmer spring
   conditions, short-distance migrants have advanced spring migratory
   phenology by more than long-distance migrants. We also find that larger
   bodied species show greater advance over time compared to smaller bodied
   species. Our results did not reveal any evidence that interspecific
   variation in migration response is predictable on the basis of species'
   habitat or diet.
   4. We detected a substantial phylogenetic signal in migration time in
   response to both year and temperature, suggesting that some of the
   shifts in migratory phenological response to climate are predictable on
   the basis of phylogeny. However, we estimate high levels of species and
   spatial variance relative to phylogenetic variance, which is consistent
   with plasticity in response to climate evolving fairly rapidly and being
   more influenced by adaptation to current local climate than by common
   descent.
   5. On average, avian spring migration times have advanced over time and
   as spring has become warmer. While we are able to identify predictors
   that explain some of the true among-species variation in response,
   substantial intra-and interspecific variation in migratory response
   remains to be explained.}},

Abstract = {{Posidonia oceanica meadows are thought to provide refuge for prey
   species, which suggests that fish communities are organized according to
   the abundance and behavior of predators. We collected published research
   on fish assemblages associated with P. oceanica meadows in the
   Mediterranean Sea and performed a meta-analysis to test hypotheses
   regarding the drivers of community structure. In 14 studies documenting
   the relative abundance of fish species, 112 taxa within a depth range of
   1-40 m were reported at local P. oceanica meadows. Sampling method had
   the most significant effect on community abundance. Total predator
   abundance and abundance of resident predators each had a significant
   effect on the prey fish community. A higher abundance of resident
   predator species such as Scorpaena notata and Zosterisessor
   ophiocephalus was associated with a lower abundance of small Symphodus
   spp., Chromis chromis, and Gobiidae, and overall lower prey species
   richness. Fish communities in P. oceanica meadows are, therefore, in
   part organized in response to the presence and abundance of piscivorous
   species, which reduces the value of seagrass as a refuge habitat for
   potential prey species. For more robust estimates of the habitat value
   of P. oceanica, a concerted international, collaborative research effort
   that applies uniform, non-destructive sampling methods, such as visual
   census or stereo-videography within and outside meadows, is needed.}},

   in neutral soils but moderate (by 15\%) in soil organic carbon (SOC)
   depleted soils, respectively in terms of soil texture, reaction and SOC
   level. Thus, soil conditions exerted great impacts on microbial
   metabolic quotient changes compared to biochar conditions. Nevertheless,
   microbial responses to biochar addition to agricultural soils were much
   uncertain with respect to both biochar and experiment conditions. Long

Abstract = {{Ocean acidification is expected to cause significant changes in the

   integrate the current knowledge, we performed a meta-analysis of
   published studies focused on benthic organisms in the Mediterranean Sea,

   vent areas. In each experiment, the effect of acidification was
   calculated as the log-transformed response ratio (LnRR) of experimental
   versus control conditions. The quantitative results obtained by the
   meta-analysis highlight: (a) an increase in fleshy algae cover, which
   may lead to a competitive advantage over calcifying macroalgae; (b) a
   reduction of calcification by both algae and corals; (c) an increase in

Abstract = {{Many ecosystems have experienced anthropogenically induced changes in
   biodiversity, yet predicting these patterns has been difficult.
   Recently, individual behavioural and physiological measures have been
   proposed as more rapid links between environmental variation and fitness
   compared to demographics. Glucocorticoid hormones have received much
   attention given that they mediate energetic demands, metabolism, and
   foraging behaviour. However, it is currently unclear whether
   glucocorticoids can reliably predict environmental and fitness-related
   traits and whether they may be useful in specific groups of taxa. In
   particular, seabirds are a well-studied avian group often employed as
   biomonitoring tools for environmental change given their wide
   distribution and reliance on large oceanic patterns. Despite the
   increase in studies attempting to link variation in baseline
   corticosterone (the primary avian glucocorticoid) to variation in
   fitness-related traits in seabirds, there has been no comprehensive
   review of the relationship in this taxon. We present a phylogenetically
   controlled systematic review and meta-analysis of correlative and
   experimental studies examining baseline corticosterone as a predictor of
   fitness-related traits relevant to predicting seabird population health.
   Our results suggest that, while variation in baseline corticosterone may
   be a useful predictor of larger-scale environmental traits such as
   overall food availability and fitness-related traits such as
   reproductive success, this hormone may not be sensitive enough to detect
   variation in body condition, foraging effort, and breeding effort.
   Overall, our results support recent work suggesting that the use of
   baseline glucocorticoids as conservation biomarkers is complex and
   highly context dependent, and we suggest caution in their use and
   interpretation as simplified, direct biomarkers of fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Many recent reviews and meta-analyses of N2O emissions do not include
   data from Mediterranean studies. In this paper we present a
   meta-analysis of the N2O emissions from Mediterranean cropping systems,
   and propose a more robust and reliable regional emission factor (EF) for
   N2O, distinguishing the effects of water management, crop type, and
   fertilizer management. The average overall EF for Mediterranean
   agriculture (EFMed) was 0.5\%, which is substantially lower than the
   IPCC default value of 1\%. Soil properties had no significant effect on
   EFs for N2O. Increasing the N fertilizer rate led to higher EFs; when N
   was applied at rates greater than 400 kg N ha(-1), the EF did riot
   significantly differ from the 1\% default value (EF: 0.82\%). Liquid
   slurries led to emissions that did not significantly differ from 1\%;
   the other fertilizer types were lower but did not significantly differ
   from each other. Rain-fed crops in Mediterranean regions have lower EFs
   (EF: 0.27\%) than irrigated crops (EF: 0.63\%). Drip irrigation systems
   (EF: 0.51\%) had 44\% lower EF than sprinkler irrigation methods (EF:
   0.91\%). Extensive crops, such as winter cereals (wheat, oat and
   barley), had lower EFs (EF: 0.26\%) than intensive crops such as maize
   (EF: 0.83\%). For flooded rice, anaerobic conditions likely led to
   complete denitrification and low EFs (EF: 0.19\%). Our results indicate
   that N2O emissions from Mediterranean Agriculture are overestimated in
   current national greenhouse gas inventories and that, with the new EF
   determined from this study, the effect of mitigation strategies such as
   drip irrigation or the use of nitrification inhibitors, even if highly
   significant, may be smaller in absolute terms. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{The ongoing increase in anthropogenic nitrogen (N) addition may have a
   substantial impact on grass-land ecosystems. Understanding the dynamics
   of the productivity and community structure of grassland ecosystems
   following N addition is important. We conducted a meta-analysis of the
   data from 2516 quadrats described in 56 published N-addition studies and
   aimed to address these questions and further describe the productivity
   and community structure of grassland ecosystems in response to N
   addition in China. Our results showed the critical threshold for
   N-induced productivity loss to grassland was variable. In meadow steppe,
   when the range of N addition occurred at rates between 7.5 and 20 gN
   m(-2) yr(-1), the aboveground net primary production (ANPP) increased,
   and below this range, the biomass of the functional groups (forb, grass,
   and sedge) decreased. Furthermore, above the range, both productivity
   and structure were negatively related to the rate of N addition. The
   critical threshold for the N-induced changes in the productivity of the
   desert steppe was 10.5 g N m(-2) yr(-1), at which production increases
   with no reduction in diversity. Additionally, the increase in ANPP with
   N addition stabilizes above approximately 12 g N m(-2) yr(-1) in desert
   steppe, and the decrease in species richness with N addition stabilizes
   above approximately 11 g N m(-2) yr(-1). Thus, at approximately 11 g N
   m(-2) yr(-1), further N addition causes no increase in production and a
   clear reduction in diversity. Our results contribute to a better

Abstract = {{Most edges are anthropogenic in origin, but are distinguishable by their
   maintaining processes (natural vs. continued anthropogenic
   interventions: forestry, agriculture, urbanization). We hypothesized
   that the dissimilar edge histories will be reflected in the diversity
   and assemblage composition of inhabitants. Testing this ``history-based
   edge effect{''} hypothesis, we evaluated published information on a
   common insect group, ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in forest
   edges. A meta-analysis showed that the diversity-enhancing properties of
   edges significantly differed according to their history. Forest edges
   maintained by natural processes had significantly higher species
   richness than their interiors, while edges with continued anthropogenic
   influence did not. The filter function of edges was also essentially
   different depending on their history. For forest specialist species,
   edges maintained by natural processes were penetrable, allowing these
   species to move right through the edges, while edges still under
   anthropogenic interventions were impenetrable, preventing the dispersal
   of forest specialists out of the forest. For species inhabiting the
   surrounding matrix (open-habitat and generalist species), edges created
   by forestry activities were penetrable, and such species also invaded
   the forest interior. However, natural forest edges constituted a barrier
   and prevented the invasion of matrix species into the forest interior.
   Preserving and protecting all edges maintained by natural processes, and
   preventing anthropogenic changes to their structure, composition, and
   characteristics are key factors to sustain biodiversity in forests.
   Moreover, the increasing presence of anthropogenic edges in a landscape
   is to be avoided, as they contribute to the loss of biodiversity.
   Simultaneously, edges under continued anthropogenic disturbance should
   be restored by increasing habitat heterogeneity.}},

   fragments yielded the strongest effect on abundance and species
   richness, while specialist herbivores were the most vulnerable to

   in studies with large spatial extent. The strong reduction in herbivore
   diversity, but not herbivory, indicates how important common generalist

Abstract = {{A wide range of taxa respond to perceived predation risk (PPR) through
   inducible defenses, and many prey are capable of responding both
   behaviorally and morphologically to the same risk event. In cases where
   multiple defenses confer protection by independent means (i.e. they are
   mechanistically independent) responses will either be co-expressed, or
   the expression of one defense will limit the capacity (or need) to
   respond along another axis. Our ability to generate a broad
   understanding of these patters has been limited, in part, by
   difficulties in comparing results across studies that employ distinct
   experimental protocols. Using the extensive literature on tadpole
   responses to PPR, we conducted a meta-analysis to identify the
   ecological and experimental determinants of inducible defence
   expression. We then assessed whether the magnitude of response to PPR
   along behavioural versus morphological response axes was positively, or
   negatively, correlated. The most commonly quantified responses to
   perceived risk in tadpoles included reductions in movement and swimming
   behaviour, and altered tail morphology. Our analyses reveal that tadpole
   behavioural responses are strongly influenced by prey family, predator
   taxon, evolutionary history with the predator (native versus
   non-native), amount of prey consumed by the predator, and how perceived
   risk was manipulated (e.g. presence versus absence of alarm cues). Tail
   morphology was similarly influenced by these factors, but also whether
   the target prey was palatable to predators. Thus, our results identify
   ecological and experimental features that critically influence the
   observed effect size in tadpole responses to PPR. A positive correlation
   between behavioural and morphological responses in studies where both
   were measured indicates that trait co-specialization is the predominant
   pattern of defense deployment in larval amphibians. This positive
   relationship suggests that survival tends to be maximized in tadpoles
   through equivalent co-activation of multiple independent axes of
   protection, opposed to maximal expression along any single axis.}},

Abstract = {{No-till (NT) has been widely regarded as a potential option to enhance
   soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration and thus mitigate climate
   change. However, recent studies have shown that previous estimates of
   SOC storage under NT seem to be overestimated due to shallow sampling
   and improper SOC accounting. In China, the overall trend and magnitude
   of changes in SOC storage in response to NT adoption remain
   inconclusive. Here we use a meta-analysis to assess the relative change
   in SOC storage (profiles >= 20 cm) based on 95 comparisons between NT
   and conventional tillage (CT) from 57 experimental sites (>= 3 years)
   covering various cropping systems, soil types, and climatic regions of
   China. The results revealed that compared to CT, adopting NT led to SOC
   accumulation in the upper 20 cm layer and SOC depletion in the 30-40 cm
   layer. On average, NT improved SOC stocks over CT by 3.8\% {[}95\%
   confidence interval (CI): 1.4\%-6.3\%; P=0.005] and 5.1\% (95\%CI:
   2.5\%-7.7\%; P < 0.001) as represented by the equivalent soil mass (ESM)
   and fixed-depth (FD) approaches, respectively. The relative change in
   SOC storage rate under NT over tilled soil for the top 30 cm layer was
   therefore significantly higher (Mean: 0.300 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), 95\%CI:
   0.054-0.547; P < 0.001) calculated by FD approach than that by ESM
   (Mean: 0.141 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1), 95\%CI: -0.102-0384; P=0.100). Further
   analysis suggested that the effect of NT on SOC storage was significant
   with residue retained, double cropping systems, and in the coarse
   textured soils. We conclude that although NT was an effective agronomy
   option for soil conservation in China, the potential for mitigation
   climate change through increased SOC sequestration by NT should not be

Abstract = {{Agricultural soils receiving synthetic fertilizers and organic
   amendments containing nitrogen contribute a large part to anthropogenic
   nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. As a source of nitrate that undergoes
   reduction to N2O, organic amendments also change soil C availability and
   redox potential, which influences the N2O emission factor (EF) of
   organically-amended soils. The objective of this study was to conduct a
   meta-analysis of N2O EF from agricultural soils receiving organic
   amendments. A global survey of peer-reviewed literature resulted in the
   selection of 38 studies including 422 observations at 43 sites in 12
   countries. The analysis yielded a global EF for all organic sources,
   EForg, equal to 0.57 +/- 0.30\%, which is lower than the IPCC default EF
   of 1 for synthetic fertilizers. Three groups of organic amendments with
   similar EFs were identified: the high-risk group including animal
   slurries, waste waters and biosolids (1.21 +/- 0.14\%); the medium-risk
   group including solid manure, composts + fertilizers, and crop residues
   + fertilizers (035 +/- 0.13\%); and the low-risk group including
   composts, crop residues, paper mill sludge and pellets (0.02 +/-
   0.13\%). The EF was higher when soils received organic amendments in
   combination with synthetic fertilizers, such as liquid manures +
   fertilizers (2.14 +/- 0.53\%), composts + fertilizers (0.37 +/- 0.24\%),
   and crop residues + fertilizers (0.59 +/- 0.27\%). The EF was modulated
   by amendment (C/N ratio), soil (texture, drainage, organic C and N) and
   climatic (precipitation) factors. For example, EFs were on average 2.8
   times greater in fine-textured than coarse-textured soils. We recommend
   site-specific EFs that consider organic amendment chemistry, soil
   characteristics, climate conditions and whether the organic amendment is
   applied alone or in combination with synthetic fertilizers. Crown

Abstract = {{Biological invasions are one of the most important ecological
   disturbances that threaten native biodiversity. An expected increase in
   the rate of species extinction will have major effects on the structure
   and function of ecosystems worldwide. The goal of our study is to
   determine which ecological properties mediate the impact of invasive
   species on biodiversity loss on a global scale using a meta-analysis. We
   considered the role of properties such as the trophic and taxonomic
   position of invaders, taxonomic groups of invaded systems, the type of
   habitats invaded and whether the invasive species is included in a list
   of the most harmful invasive species for biodiversity loss. We compiled
   185 studies that included 253 numerical values of changes of species
   richness due to species invasion. We investigated the role of trophic
   and taxonomic parameters of invaders, as well as the role of abiotic
   parameters of habitat on changes in species richness due to biological
   invasions. Our results show that plant invaders are highly represented
   (85\% of all invaders studied), especially those belonging to the
   Poaceae family. For animals, predation seems to be the feeding behaviour
   associated with the greatest decrease in species richness and this
   relationship is independent of habitat type, with a 21\% decline
   observed in aquatic habitats and a 27\% decline in terrestrial habitats.
   In invaded communities, birds suffer the greatest decline in species
   richness (41\% decline). Finally, we found that species richness
   declines in Europe are spatially autocorrelated, suggesting that the
   consequences of invasive species cannot be understood through
   local-scale analysis alone.}},

Abstract = {{It has been claimed that Holistic Planned Grazing (TM) (HPG), a type of
   rotational grazing, can increase productivity in rangelands and reverse
   climate change while doubling the stocking rate, mainly through the
   impact of densely bunched animals on primary production. Previous
   reviews have found similar or greater plant and animal production in
   continuous (season-long) compared with rotational grazing. Here
   season-long continuous grazing is compared with HPG alone to explore the
   evidence for animal impact. Three quantitative meta-analysis models were
   used to assess data sets from literature between 1972 and 2016. Weighted
   mean differences (effect sizes) between HPG and continuous grazing
   showed that there was no difference in plant basal cover, plant biomass
   and animal gain responses (p > 0.05). Thus, from the balance of studies,
   if animal impact is occurring during HPG, it has no effect on
   production. As interesting as the overall result is the significant
   between-study heterogeneity assessed using Cochran's Q (p = 0.007 to <
   0.0001). Studies with positive effect sizes tended to have higher
   precipitation (p < 0.05), suggesting that only some rangelands have the
   resources to support HPG. Furthermore, there is scope for investigating
   the impact of HPG on socio-ecological aspects of rangelands, such as
   management.}},

Title = {{FIRE REDUCES FUNGAL SPECIES RICHNESS AND IN SITU MYCORRHIZAL
   COLONIZATION: A META-ANALYSIS}},
Journal = {{FIRE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{37-65}},
Abstract = {{Soil fungal communities perform many functions that help plants meet
   their nutritional demands. However, overall trends for fungal response
   to fire, which can be especially critical in a post-fire context, have
   been difficult to elucidate. We used meta-analytical techniques to
   investigate fungal response to fire across studies, ecosystems, and fire
   types. Change in fungal species richness and mycorrhizal colonization
   were used as the effect size metrics in random effects models. When
   different types of methods for assessing fungal species richness and
   mycorrhizal colonization were considered together, there was an average
   reduction of 28 \% in fungal species richness post fire, but no
   significant response in mycorrhizal colonization. In contrast, there was
   a 41 \% reduction in fungal species richness post fire when assessed by
   sporocarp surveys, but fungal species richness was not significantly
   affected when assessed by molecular methods. Measured in situ, fire
   reduced mycorrhizal colonization by 21 \%, yet no significant response
   occurred when assessed by ex situ bioassays. These findings suggest that
   the putative magnitude of fire effects on soil fungal communities may be
   dependent on the approach and assessment method used. Furthermore,
   biome, but not fire type (i.e., wildfire versus prescribed fire) was a
   significant moderator of our categorical models, suggesting that biome
   might be a more useful predictor of fungal species richness response to
   fire than fire type. Reductions in fungal species richness and in situ
   mycorrhizal colonization post fire declined logarithmically and
   approached zero (i.e., no effect) at 22 and 11 years, respectively. We
   concluded that fire reduces fungal species richness and in situ
   mycorrhizal colonization, but if conditions allow communities to recover
   (e.g., without subsequent disturbance, favorable growing conditions),
   soil fungi are resilient on decadal time scales; the resiliency of soil
   fungi likely contributes to the overall rapid ecosystem recovery
   following fire.}},

Abstract = {{Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in vertebrates are
   integral for effective adaptive immune response and are associated with
   sexual selection. Evidence from a range of vertebrates supports
   MHC-based preference for diverse and dissimilar mating partners, but
   evidence from human mate choice studies has been disparate and
   controversial. Methodologies and sampling peculiarities specific to
   human studies make it difficult to know whether wide discrepancies in
   results among human populations are real or artefact. To better
   understand what processes may affect MHC-mediated mate choice across
   humans and nonhuman primates, we performed phylogenetically controlled
   meta-analyses using 58 effect sizes from 30 studies across seven primate
   species. Primates showed a general trend favouring more MHC-diverse
   mates, which was statistically significant for humans. In contrast,
   there was no tendency for MHC-dissimilar mate choice, and for humans, we
   observed effect sizes indicating selection of both MHC-dissimilar and
   MHC-similar mates. Focusing on MHC-similar effect sizes only, we found
   evidence that preference for MHC similarity was an artefact of
   population ethnic heterogeneity in observational studies but not among
   experimental studies with more control over sociocultural biases. This
   suggests that human assortative mating biases may be responsible for
   some patterns of MHC-based mate choice. Additionally, the overall effect
   sizes of primate MHC-based mating preferences are relatively weak
   (Fisher's Z correlation coefficient for dissimilarity Zr=0.044,
   diversity Zr=0.153), calling for careful sampling design in future
   studies. Overall, our results indicate that preference for more
   MHC-diverse mates is significant for humans and likely conserved across
   primates.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a meta-analysis of the effects of fire on the abundance and
   alpha diversity of ants based upon data published over the past 70
   years. Overall, fire reduced ant diversity by 18 \%, but had no effect
   on ant abundance. However, there was significant variation in the effect
   of fire on ant diversity amongst different vegetation types. Fire
   significantly decreased ant diversity in forests-especially in tropical
   forests-whereas in deserts, grasslands, and savannas it did not.
   Similarly, fire had a strong negative mean effect on ant diversity in
   sites where it is uncommon, but did not significantly affect diversity
   where it is a recurrent phenomenon. There is evidence that, in forests,
   wildfires have a stronger negative effect on ant diversity than does
   prescribed burning. In addition, we found marginally significant
   differences in the effect of fire on the abundance and diversity of
   forest ants among studies that sampled ants at different times
   post-fire, or that sampled ants from different soil strata. In contrast,
   fire did not significantly affect the abundance or diversity of savanna
   ants, and this was true even after we took into account the geographic
   location of the study, the ant community sampled, the time since fire,
   and the fire regime. Overall, the results of our study indicate that
   habitat type is an important predictor of ant community responses to
   fire. However, even within a given habitat, reported effects were quite
   variable among the studies reviewed, evidencing the idiosyncratic nature
   of fire effects on ants.}},

Abstract = {{Australia supports a high diversity of sequestrate (truffle-like)
   macrofungi. This has long been thought to be related to the
   predominantly or seasonally dry climate. The present study posits that
   if aridity were a key factor in the evolution of sequestrate
   fruit-bodies, most sequestrate species would have emerged in Australia
   only after it began to aridify, which occurred post-separation with
   Antarctica (c. 32 million years ago). Focusing on the high phylogenetic
   diversity of sequestrate taxa in the Agaricomycetes in Australia, dates
   of sequestrate nodes were compiled directly from published phylogenies
   (four lineages) or created using sequences available on GenBank that
   were processed in BEAST using a secondary calibration method (nine
   lineages). Although the morphologically diverse Hysterangiales was found
   to be the first group to become sequestrate, c. 83 million years ago,
   overall sequestration in Australia occurred more recently. Models were
   created and compared and support was found for an increased rate of
   sequestration in Australia at some point between 34 and 13 million years
   ago (during the Oligocene and Miocene). Although the rate of
   sequestration is shown to have increased in Australia after separation
   from Antarctica, the timing also overlaps with the radiation of
   potential mycorrhizal plant associates, and the emergence of specialised
   mycophagous marsupials. Although aridification is evidently not the sole
   driver of sequestration, it is still likely to have had a major
   influence on the diversity of sequestrate fungi in Australia.
   Comparisons with other regions of high sequestrate diversity will be
   informative.}},

Abstract = {{Meta-analysis is the gold standard for synthesis in ecology and
   evolution. Together with estimating overall effect magnitudes,
   meta-analyses estimate differences between effect sizes via
   heterogeneity statistics. It is widely hypothesized that heterogeneity
   will be present in ecological/evolutionary meta-analyses due to the
   system-specific nature of biological phenomena. Despite driving
   recommended best practices, the generality of heterogeneity in
   ecological data has never been systematically reviewed. We reviewed 700
   studies, finding 325 that used formal meta-analysis, of which total
   heterogeneity was reported in fewer than 40\%. We used second-order
   meta-analysis to collate heterogeneity statistics from 86 studies. Our
   analysis revealed that the median and mean heterogeneity, expressed as
   I-2, are 84.67\% and 91.69\%, respectively. These estimates are well
   above high heterogeneity (i.e., 75\%), based on widely adopted
   benchmarks. We encourage reporting heterogeneity in the forms of I-2 and
   the estimated variance components (e.g., (2)) as standard practice.
   These statistics provide vital insights in to the degree to which effect
   sizes vary, and provide the statistical support for the exploration of
   predictors of effect-size magnitude. Along with standard meta-regression
   techniques that fit moderator variables, multi-level models now allow
   partitioning of heterogeneity among correlated (e.g., phylogenetic)
   structures that exist within data.}},

Journal = {{ECOTOXICOLOGY}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1858-1866}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The regulatory decision-making process regarding chemical safety is most
   often informed by evidence based on ecotoxicity tests that consider
   growth, reproduction and survival as end-points, which can be
   quantitatively linked to short-term population outcomes. Changes in
   these end-points resulting from chemical exposure can cause alterations
   in micro-evolutionary forces (mutation, drift, selection and gene flow)
   that control the genetic composition of populations. With
   multi-generation exposures, anthropogenic contamination can lead to a
   population with an altered genetic composition, which may respond
   differently to future stressors. These evolutionary changes are rarely
   discussed in regulatory or risk assessment frameworks, but the growing
   body of literature that documents their existence suggests that these
   important population-level impacts should be considered. In this
   meta-analysis we have compared existing contamination levels of
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs) that have been documented to be associated with evolutionary
   changes in resident aquatic organisms to regulatory benchmarks for these
   contaminants. The original intent of this project was to perform a
   meta-analysis on evolutionary events associated with PCB and PAH
   contamination. However, this effort was hindered by a lack of
   consistency in congener selection for ``total{''} PCB or PAH
   measurements. We expanded this manuscript to include a discussion of
   methods used to determine PCB and PAH total contamination in addition to
   comparing regulatory guidelines and contamination that has caused
   evolutionary effects. Micro-evolutionary responses often lead
   populations onto unique and unpredictable trajectories. Therefore, to
   better understand the risk of population-wide alterations occurring, we
   need to improve comparisons of chemical contamination between affected
   locations. In this manuscript we offer several possibilities to unify
   chemical comparisons for PCBs and PAHs that would improve comparability
   among evolutionary toxicology investigations, and with regulatory
   guidelines. In addition, we identify studies documenting evolutionary
   change in the presence of PCB and PAH contamination levels below
   applicable regulatory benchmarks.}},

Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2789-2808}},

Abstract = {{In many birds, males are presumed to protect their paternity by closely
   guarding their mate or copulating frequently with her. Both these costly
   behaviors are assumed to reduce the risk and/or intensity of sperm
   competition. However, despite many studies on avian extra-pair
   paternity, it remains unclear how strongly these behaviors are related
   to fitness and other key life-history traits. Here, we conduct
   meta-analyses to address two questions. First, are mate guarding and/or
   frequent copulation positively correlated with a male's share of
   paternity at his nest? We find a significant positive correlation
   between both presumed paternity protection behaviors and paternity
   share. The relationship is, however, weak (r = 0.08-0.23). This is
   perhaps unsurprising if the risk of partner infidelity, hence the need
   to protect paternity, varies among males. For example, more attractive
   males might have less need to protect their paternity. Second, do males
   with higher indices of so-called male ``quality{''} (phenotypic
   measures, usually subjectively defined by researchers as predictors of
   male attractiveness) exhibit lower levels of paternity protection
   behavior? We find a negative correlation between male quality and
   paternity protection. This finding might partly explain the weak
   relationship between paternity protection and paternity, although we
   discuss other, nonmutually exclusive possibilities.}},

Abstract = {{How herbivores respond to resource heterogeneity is important for
   predicting plant resistance to herbivores. Experimental studies thus far
   have revealed that herbivore responses differ depending on whether
   herbivores are offered single or multiple plant types, but the reports
   have rarely been combined. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 47
   publications on choice and no-choice experiments to reveal how the
   presence/absence of multiple plants (i.e., choice/no-choice conditions)
   alters the extent of behavioral avoidance by herbivores. The herbivore
   diet breadth and response traits (feeding, growth, or oviposition)
   explained a significantly large amount of heterogeneity in the herbivore
   response under choice and no-choice conditions. In contrast, a small
   amount of heterogeneity was explained by the herbivore types
   (vertebrates, exophagous, or endophagous invertebrates), plant
   resistance traits (chemical or nonchemical), plant life form, and
   relatedness of plant pairs (intraspecific or interspecific) as well as
   interactions between the herbivore and plant characteristics. Compared
   with the no-choice conditions, specialist herbivores further avoided
   suboptimal plants under choice conditions. Generalist herbivores more
   evenly - utilized optimal and suboptimal plants under choice conditions.
   The avoidance of suboptimal plants - under choice conditions was the
   most prominent in oviposition response. Thus, our meta-analysis found
   that herbivore characteristics rather than plant traits were more
   responsible for driving behavioral avoidance by herbivores to a
   particular plant. The contrasting response between specialist and
   generalist herbivores to plant heterogeneity may be more ubiquitous than
   previously thought.}},

Volume = {{203}},
Pages = {{313-320}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Roaming pet cats Felis catus are a significant conservation issue
   because they may hunt, harass and compete with wildlife; spread disease,
   interbreed with cats in feral populations, and hybridise with wild
   native felids. Studies of the roaming behaviour of pet cats are often
   hampered by modest sample sizes and variability between cats, limiting
   statistical significance of the findings and their usefulness in
   recommending measures to discourage roaming. We resolved these
   difficulties through meta-analyses of 25 studies from 10 countries
   involving 469 pet cats to assess the influence of sex, whether a cat was
   desexed and housing density on roaming. A complementary linear mixed
   models approach used data on 311 individual animals from 22 studies and
   was also able to assess the influence of age and husbandry practices on
   roaming. This restricted sample gave greater statistical power than the
   meta-analyses.
   Meta-analyses found that: male pet cats had larger home ranges than
   females, desexing did not influence home range, and cats had larger home
   ranges when housing densities were low. The linear mixed models
   supported those results. They also indicated that animals years old had
   smaller home ranges than younger cats. Cats fed regularly, provided with
   veterinary care and socialised with humans had similar home ranges to
   cats living in association with households but not provided for in some
   of these ways. Short of confinement, there is no simple measure owners
   can adopt to reduce roaming by their cats and prevent the associated
   environmental problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Intra-guild predation (IGP) - where a top predator (IG(Pred)) consumes
   both a basal resource and a competitor for that resource (IG(Prey)) -
   has become a fundamental part of understanding species interactions and
   community dynamics. IGP communities composed of intraguild predators and
   prey have been well studied; however, we know less about IGP communities
   composed of predators, pathogens, and resources. Resource quality plays
   an important role in community dynamics and may influence IGP dynamics
   as well. We conducted a meta-analysis on predator-pathogen-resource
   communities to determine whether resource quality mediated by the
   pathogen affected predator life-history traits and if these effects met
   the theoretical constraints of IGP communities. To do this, we
   summarized results from studies that investigated the use of predators
   and pathogens to control insect pests. In these systems, the predators
   are the IG(Pred) and pathogens are the IG(Prey). We found that consumer
   longevity, fecundity, and survival decreased by 26\%, 31\% and 13\%
   respectively, when predators consumed pathogen-infected prey, making the
   infected prey a low quality resource. Predators also significantly
   preferred healthy prey over infected prey. When we divided consumers by
   enemy type, strict predators (e.g. wolf spiders) had no preference while
   parasitoids preferred healthy prey. Our results suggest that communities
   containing parasitoids and pathogens may rarely exhibit intraguild
   predation; whereas, communities composed of strict predators and
   pathogens are more likely dominated by IGP dynamics. In these latter
   communities, the consumption of low and high quality resources suggests
   that IGP communities composed of strict predators, pathogens and prey
   should naturally persist, supporting IGP theory.
   Synthesis We investigated how consuming pathogen-infected prey influence
   important life-history parameters of insect predators. Pathogens are
   used in a variety of biocontrol programs, especially to control crop
   pests. We found that true predators (i.e. wolf spiders) have no
   preference for healthy or infected prey and have reduced fecundity,
   survival and longevity consuming infected prey. However, parasitoids
   avoided infected prey when possible. In biocontrol programs with
   multiple control agents, parasitoids and pathogens would do a better job
   controlling pests as predators would reduce the amount of pathogen

Abstract = {{Increasing atmospheric nitrogen (N) inputs have the potential to alter
   terrestrial ecosystem function through impacts on plant-herbivore
   interactions. The goal of our study is to search for a general pattern
   in responses of tree characteristics important for herbivores and insect
   herbivorous performance to elevated N inputs. We conducted a
   meta-analysis based on 109 papers describing impacts of nitrogen inputs
   on tree characteristics and 16 papers on insect performance. The
   differences in plant characteristics and insect performance between
   broadleaves and conifers were also explored. Tree aboveground biomass,
   leaf biomass and leaf N concentration significantly increased under
   elevated N inputs. Elevated N inputs had no significantly overall effect
   on concentrations of phenolic compounds and lignin but adversely
   affected tannin, as defensive chemicals for insect herbivores.
   Additionally, the overall effect of insect herbivore performance
   (including development time, insect biomass, relative growth rate, and
   so on) was significantly increased by elevated N inputs. According to
   the inconsistent responses between broadleaves and conifers, broadleaves
   would be more likely to increase growth by light interception and
   photosynthesis rather than producing more defensive chemicals to
   elevated N inputs by comparison with conifers. Moreover, the overall
   carbohydrate concentration was significantly reduced by 13.12\% in
   broadleaves while increased slightly in conifers. The overall tannin
   concentration decreased significantly by 39.21\% in broadleaves but a
   5.8\% decrease in conifers was not significant. The results of the
   analysis indicated that elevated N inputs would provide more food
   sources and ameliorate tree palatability for insects, while the
   resistance of trees against their insect herbivores was weakened,
   especially for broadleaves. Thus, global forest insect pest problems
   would be aggravated by elevated N inputs. As N inputs continue to rise
   in the future, forest ecosystem management should pay more attention to
   insect pest, especially in the regions dominated by broadleaves. (C)

Title = {{Soil carbon sequestration rates under Mediterranean woody crops using
   recommended management practices: A meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{235}},
Pages = {{204-214}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Mediterranean woody crops, such as olive and almond farming, and
   vineyards are usually cultivated in soils low in organic matter, with
   limited water availability and frequently on medium to steep slopes.
   Therefore, when conventionally cultivated, soils of these cropping
   systems are net sources of CO2 (throughout soil erosion and organic
   carbon mineralization). A promising option to sequester carbon (C) in
   these cropping systems is the implementation of recommended management
   practices (RMPs), which include plant cover in the inter-row area,
   minimum or no tillage and off- and on-farm organic matter amendments.
   However, the effects of RMPs onsoil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in these
   cropping systems are widely overlooked, despite the critical importance
   of estimating their contribution on CO2 emissions for policy decisions
   in the agriculture sector in Mediterranean regions. We therefore
   conducted a meta analysis to derive a C response ratio, soil C
   sequestration rate and soil C sequestration efficiency under RMPs,
   compared to conventional management of olive and almond orchards, and
   vineyards (144 data sets from 51 references). RMPs included organic
   amendments (OA), plant cover (CC) and a combination of the two (CMP).
   The highest soil C sequestration rate (5.3 t C ha(-1) yr(-1)) was
   observed following the application OA in olive orchards. (especially
   after olive mill pomace application), whereas CC management achieved the
   lowest C sequestration rates (1.1, 0.78 and 2.0 t C ha(-1) yr(-1), for
   olive orchards, vineyards and almond orchards, respectively). Efficiency
   of soil C sequestration was greater than 100\% after OA and CMP
   managements, indicating that: i) some of the organic C inputs were
   unaccounted for, and ii) a positive feedback effect of the application
   of these amendments on SOC retention (e.g. reduction of soil erosion)
   and on protective mechanisms of the SOC which reduce CO2 emissions. Soil
   C sequestration rate tended to be highest during the first years after
   the change of the management and progressively decreased. Studies
   performed in Mediterranean sub-climates of low annual precipitation had
   lower values of soil C sequestration rate, likely due to a lower biomass
   production of the crop and other plant cover. Soil C sequestration rates
   in olive farming were much higher than that of vineyards, mainly due to
   the application of higher annual doses of organic amendments. The
   relatively high sequestration rate combined with the relative large
   spatial extent of these cropping system areas suggests that the adoption
   of RMPs is a sustainable and efficient measure to mitigate climate
   change. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Natural regeneration offers a cheaper alternative to active
   reforestation and has the potential to become the predominant way of
   restoring degraded tropical landscapes at large-scale. We conducted a
   meta-analysis for tropical regions and quantified the relationships
   between both ecological and socioeconomic factors and biodiversity
   responses in naturally regenerating areas. Biogeographic realms, past
   disturbance, and the human development index (HDI) were used as
   explanatory variables for biodiversity responses. In addition, we
   present a case study of large-scale natural regeneration in the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest and identify areas where different forms of
   restoration would be most suitable. Using our dataset for tropical
   regions, we showed that natural regeneration was predominantly reported
   within: the Neotropical realm; areas that were intensively disturbed;
   and countries with medium HDI. We also found that biodiversity in
   regenerating forests was more similar to the values found in old growth
   forests in: countries with either low, high, or very high HDI; less
   biodiverse realms; and areas of less intensive past disturbance. Our
   case study from Brazil showed that the level of forest gain resulting
   from environmental legislation, in particular the Brazilian Forest Code,
   has been reduced, but remains substantial. Complementary market
   incentives and financial mechanisms to promote large-scale natural
   regeneration in human-modified agricultural landscapes are also needed.
   Our analysis provides insights into the factors that promote or limit
   the recovery of biodiversity in naturally regenerating areas, and aids
   to identify areas with higher potential for natural regeneration.

Abstract = {{AimPositive relationships between plant species diversity and
   above-ground productivity have been observed across a wide range of
   terrestrial ecosystems. Despite a critical contribution of below-ground
   productivity to overall terrestrial productivity, no consensus exists
   about the nature of the relationship between species diversity and
   below-ground productivity.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe collected data from published studies conducted in natural and
   planted forests and experimental grassland, crop and pot systems that
   were purposely implemented to isolate the effects of plant species
   diversity from other factors, such as soil conditions and topographic
   features. We conducted meta-analyses of 170 observations for root
   biomass and 23 observations for root production, derived from 48
   published studies, using weighted linear modelling with bootstrap
   procedures to reconcile the effects of diversity on fine root
   productivity.
   ResultsWe found that species mixtures had, on average 28.4\% higher fine
   root biomass and 44.8\% higher annual production than monocultures.
   Higher fine root biomass in species mixtures than in monocultures was
   consistent across natural forests, planted grasslands, croplands and pot
   systems, except for young planted forests. Transgressive overyielding
   was only evident for planted grasslands. The log response ratio of fine
   root biomass in species mixtures to that in respective monocultures
   increased with species richness across all ecosystem types, and also
   increased with experiment age in grasslands.
   Main conclusionsOur meta-analysis reveals positive effects of species
   diversity on below-ground productivity. Despite profound differences in
   environments among terrestrial ecosystems, our analysis demonstrated
   that below-ground productivity responds similarly to variations in
   species richness. Furthermore, our study also reveals shifts in the
   effects of diversity over time in both forests and grasslands. Future
   efforts are needed to further understand below-ground
   productivity-diversity relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Global model estimates of soil carbon changes from past land-use changes
   remain uncertain. We develop an approach for evaluating dynamic global
   vegetation models (DGVMs) against existing observational meta-analyses
   of soil carbon changes following land-use change. Using the DGVM JSBACH,
   we perform idealized simulations where the entire globe is covered by
   one vegetation type, which then undergoes a land-use change to another
   vegetation type. We select the grid cells that represent the climatic
   conditions of the meta-analyses and compare the mean simulated soil
   carbon changes to the meta-analyses. Our simulated results show model
   agreement with the observational data on the direction of changes in
   soil carbon for some land-use changes, although the model simulated a
   generally smaller magnitude of changes. The conversion of crop to forest
   resulted in soil carbon gain of 10\% compared to a gain of 42\% in the
   data, whereas the forest-to-crop change resulted in a simulated loss of
   15\% compared to 40 \%. The model and the observational data disagreed
   for the conversion of crop to grasslands. The model estimated a small
   soil carbon loss (4 \%), while observational data indicate a 38\% gain
   in soil carbon for the same land-use change. These model deviations from
   the observations are substantially reduced by explicitly accounting for
   crop harvesting and ignoring burning in grasslands in the model. We
   conclude that our idealized simulation approach provides an appropriate
   framework for evaluating DGVMs against meta-analyses and that this
   evaluation helps to identify the causes of deviation of simulated soil
   carbon changes from the meta-analyses.}},

Title = {{The effect of dietary restriction on reproduction: a meta-analytic
   perspective}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Dietary restriction (DR), a reduction in the amount of food
   or particular nutrients eaten, is the most consistent environmental
   manipulation to extend lifespan and protect against age related
   diseases. Current evolutionary theory explains this effect as a shift in
   the resolution of the trade-off between lifespan and reproduction.
   However, recent studies have questioned the role of reproduction in
   mediating the effect of DR on longevity and no study has quantitatively
   investigated the effect of DR on reproduction across species.
   Results: Here we report a comprehensive comparative meta-analysis of the
   effect of DR on reproduction. In general, DR reduced reproduction across
   taxa, but several factors moderated this effect. The effect of DR on
   reproduction was greater in well-studied model species (yeast, nematode
   worms, fruit flies and rodents) than non-model species. This mirrors
   recent results for longevity and, for reproduction, seems to result from
   a faster rate of decline with decreasing resources in model species. Our
   results also suggested that not all reproductive traits are affected
   equally by DR. High and moderate cost reproductive traits suffered a
   significant reduction with DR, but low cost traits, such as ejaculate
   production, did not. Although the effect of DR on reproduction was
   stronger in females than males, this sex difference reduced to near zero
   when accounting for other co-factors such as the costliness of the
   reproductive trait. Thus, sex differences in the effect of DR on
   longevity may be due to a failure to expose males to as complete a range
   of the costs of reproduction as females.
   Conclusions: We suggest that to better understand the generality of the
   effect of DR, future studies should attempt to address the cause of the
   apparent model species bias and ensure that individuals are exposed to
   as many of the costs of reproduction as possible. Furthermore, our
   meta-analytic approach reveals a general shortage of DR studies that
   record reproduction, particularly in males, as well as a lack of direct
   side-by-side comparisons of the effect of DR on males and females.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the recovery of species diversity and composition after major
   disturbance is key to understanding the resilience of tropical forests
   through successional processes, and its importance for biodiversity
   conservation. Despite the specific abiotic environment and ecological
   processes of tropical dry forests, secondary succession has received
   less attention in this biome than others and changes in species
   diversity and composition have never been synthesised in a systematic
   and quantitative review. This study aims to assess in tropical dry
   forests 1) the directionality of change in species richness and evenness
   during secondary succession, 2) the convergence of species composition
   towards that of old-growth forest and 3) the importance of the previous
   land use, precipitation regime and water availability in influencing the
   direction and rate of change. We conducted meta-analyses of the rate of
   change in species richness, evenness and composition indices with
   succession in 13 tropical dry forest chronosequences. Species richness
   increased with succession, showing a gradual accumulation of species, as
   did Shannon evenness index. The similarity in species composition of
   successional forests with old-growth forests increased with succession,
   yet at a low rate. Tropical dry forests therefore do show resilience of
   species composition but it may never reach that of old-growth forests.
   We found no significant differences in rates of change between different
   previous land uses, precipitation regimes or water availability. Our
   results show high resilience of tropical dry forests in term of species
   richness but a slow recovery of species composition. They highlight the
   need for further research on secondary succession in this biome and
   better understanding of impacts of previous land-use and landscape-scale
   patterns.
   Synthesis Secondary forests account for an increasing proportion of
   remaining tropical forest. Assessing their resilience is key to
   conservation of their biodiversity. Our study is the first meta-analysis
   of species changes during succession focussing on tropical dry forests,
   a highly threatened yet understudied biome. We show a gradual species
   accumulation and convergence of composition towards that of old-growth
   forests. While secondary tropical dry forests offer good potential for
   biodiversity conservation, their capacity for recovery at a sufficient
   rate to match threats is uncertain. Further research on this biome is

Abstract = {{Decisions about cultural and historical heritage conservation can be
   contentious. Improved insight into the economic benefits derived from
   preservation could be achieved through a better understanding of the

   this study is to identify common drivers of the economic value of
   cultural and historical heritage by conducting a meta-analysis of
   heritage valuation studies. We find that heritage sites in areas with
   higher population density hold higher value, and conservation that
   supports adaptive re-use of sites generates higher values then passive
   protection. Valuation studies of tangible heritage dominate our dataset,
   but our findings are robust across model specifications. We identify a
   need for more economic and interdisciplinary research on the value of

Abstract = {{An increasing number of studies have aimed to clarify the factors
   leading human groups to prioritize the use of some woody plant species
   compared to others. Some of these studies have tested the apparency
   hypothesis in aiming to understand this phenomenon. According to the
   apparency hypothesis, the most commonly available local plant species on
   a forest path are the most useful to that local human population.
   However, the sparse and diverse nature of the results from studies
   investigating the factors that influence human exploitation of plant
   resources motivated us to perform a meta-analysis on the apparency
   hypothesis. We searched in the main databases (Scopus, ScienceDirect,
   Google Scholar, and Scielo) for studies that correlated the
   environmental availability of woody species (estimated through
   vegetation parameters) with the degree of importance of such species to
   the local human population (estimated by means of the use value index).
   Overall, this meta-analysis supported the apparency hypothesis, although
   we also found high levels of heterogeneity in these studies. When the
   distinct uses of woody flora were considered separately, we found that
   local species availability is important for fuelwood (firewood and
   charcoal) and construction (houses, fences, etc.) purposes but does not
   explain medicinal and technological (object manufacture) plant use. We
   found no important differences in correlation values between the degree
   of species importance for people and the different vegetation
   parameters, although correlations are slightly higher for the dominance
   and importance value index. Our findings suggest that the exploitation
   of woody flora is influenced by local availability.}},

Abstract = {{Given the extent of global ecosystem degradation resulting from

   the largest terrestrial ecosystem globally and in China, has high
   ecological and economic value. We performed a meta-analysis to assess
   the impacts of grassland restoration on biodiversity and ecosystem
   services in China. The results showed that grassland restoration
   improved biodiversity by 32.44\% and ecosystem services by 30.43\%,
   although the restored grassland from degraded conditions failed to reach
   the level of non-degraded reference conditions for biodiversity and

   restored grassland compared to the degraded and reference grassland.
   Restoration outcomes of biodiversity and ecosystem services were
   affected by different restoration approaches, but restoration age was
   not detected as significantly correlated with biodiversity and ecosystem

Abstract = {{Meta-analysis is increasingly used to synthesize major patterns in the

   In some cases, informal meta-analyses may produce results that are
   unbiased, but do not necessarily make the best possible use of available
   data. In other cases, unbiased statistical noise in individual reports
   in the literature can potentially be converted into severe systematic
   biases in informal meta-analyses. I first present a general description
   of how failure to account for noise in individual inferences should be
   expected to lead to biases in some kinds of meta-analysis. In
   particular, informal meta-analyses of quantities that reflect the
   dispersion of parameters in nature, for example, the mean absolute value
   of a quantity, are likely to be generally highly misleading. I then
   re-analyse three previously published informal meta-analyses, where key
   inferences were of aspects of the dispersion of values in nature, for
   example, the mean absolute value of selection gradients. Major
   biological conclusions in each original informal meta-analysis closely
   match those that could arise as artefacts due to statistical noise. I

Abstract = {{Identifying and protecting coastal nursery habitats is imperative as
   human impacts to these areas accelerate. Nursery habitats support higher
   juvenile (1) density, (2) growth, or (3) survival (hereafter nursery
   role metrics) than other habitats, resulting in a greater contribution
   to adult populations. Seagrass habitat is commonly referred to as a
   nursery, but its contribution to each nursery role metric across
   geographic regions and in comparison to other nursery habitats (e.g.
   mangroves, coral reefs, salt marshes) remains unclear. We conducted a
   global meta-analysis of juvenile fish and macro-invertebrate performance
   in seagrass relative to other habitats to assess the nursery role
   metric, geographic region, and taxonomic group for which seagrass is
   most beneficial. We compiled data from 51 papers, spanning temperate,
   subtropical, and tropical regions and including unstructured and
   structured comparative habitats. We found that, overall, seagrass
   provided better nursery habitat than other habitats, particularly for
   supporting high juvenile density and growth. Seagrass habitat was
   generally more beneficial in temperate and subtropical regions than in
   the tropics, and more important for juvenile invertebrates than for
   fishes. Seagrass appears to be highly valuable for provision of food,
   but supplies equivalent or less adequate refuge than other nursery
   habitats. Management efforts may benefit from prioritizing conservation
   of seagrass habitats as food sources for juveniles in combination with
   other structured habitats for refuge in temperate regions; in tropical
   regions, seagrass may be a less important nursery habitat to target for
   conservation, though the value of nursery habitats may shift with

Abstract = {{Organic fertilizer applications that boost soil fertility and crop
   production are expected to enhance soil biodiversity, making ecosystems
   more resilient to stress. Numerous studies have compared biodiversity in
   soil receiving organic fertilizer to soil under other fertilizer regimes
   (inorganic fertilizers, unfertilized), yet the data were not analyzed
   systematically across studies. We evaluated fertilizer effects on soil
   nematode communities with a meta-analysis of more than 229 data points
   from 54 studies around the world that were published between 1996 and
   2015. Data were from cropland and considered five fertilizer regimes.
   These regimes include unfertilized soils and those receiving inorganic
   fertilizers (2 regimes), as well as organic fertilizers (2 regimes).
   Species richness and total nematode abundance increased with increasing
   carbon (C) inputs from fertilizers, whereas greater nitrogen (N)
   application rates from fertilizers significantly reduced the species
   richness, Shannon's diversity (H'), maturity index (MI) and
   omnivore-predator nematode abundance. This could indicate that high
   fertilizer N inputs simplifies the nematode community structure and
   functions. Species richness, omnivore-predator nematode abundance and
   structural index (SI) increased with the organically-fertilized regime
   and declined in inorganically-fertilized regimes, suggesting that
   organic fertilizers can buffer stresses and sustain soil food web
   functions. Furthermore, organic fertilizers differed in their impact on
   soil nematodes, as those with C-rich crop residues supported larger
   free-living nematode populations and greatly promoted H', SI and
   enrichment index (EI), whereas N-rich animal manure was more effective
   in controlling plant-feeding nematodes. Our review suggests that the
   application of C-rich crop residues is the most effective practice to
   enhance soil biodiversity in intensively managed agroecosystems,
   highlighting the importance of regular applications of straw and other
   C-rich residues to preserve the ecological resilience of cropland. (C)

Abstract = {{Darwin's naturalization hypothesis (DNH), which predicts that alien

   naturalize, has received much recent attention. The mixed findings from
   empirical studies that have tested DNH, however, seem to defy
   generalizations. Using meta-analysis to synthesize results of existing
   studies, we show that the predictive power of DNH depends on both the
   invasion stage and the spatial scale of the studies. Alien species more
   closely related to natives tended to be less successful at the local
   scale, supporting DNH; invasion success, however, was unaffected by
   alien native relatedness at the regional scale. On the other hand, alien
   species with stronger impacts on native communities tended to be more
   closely related to natives at the local scale, but less closely related
   to natives at the regional scale. These patterns are generally
   consistent across different ecosystems, taxa and investigation methods.

Abstract = {{Life-history theory predicts that nutrition influences lifespan owing to
   trade-offs between allocating resources to reproduction, growth and

   lifespan, it is unclear whether this prediction is generally supported

   studies manipulating pre- or post-natal diet and measuring longevity. We
   found no overall effect of early diet on lifespan. We used
   meta-regression, considering moderator variables based on experimental
   and life-history traits, to test predictions regarding the strength and
   direction of effects that could lead to positive or negative effects.
   Pre-natal diet manipulations reduced lifespan, but there were no effects
   of later diet, manipulation type, development mode, or sex. The results
   are consistent with the prediction that early diet restriction disrupts
   growth and results in increased somatic damage, which incurs lifespan
   costs. Our findings raise a cautionary note, however, for placing too
   strong an emphasis on early diet effects on lifespan and highlight

Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, an increasing number of studies have
   quantified the effects of herbivory on plant populations using
   stage-structured population models and integral projection models,
   allowing for the calculation of plant population growth rates (lambda)
   with and without herbivory. In this paper, I assembled 29 studies and
   conducted a meta-regression to determine the importance of invertebrate
   herbivores to population growth rates (lambda) while accounting for
   missing data. I found that invertebrate herbivory often induced
   important reductions in plant population growth rates (with herbivory,
   lambda was 1.08 +/- 0.36; without herbivory, lambda was 1.28 +/- 0.58).
   This relationship tended to be weaker for seed predation than for other
   types of herbivory, except when seed predation rates were very high.
   Even so, the amount by which studies reduced herbivory was a poor
   predictor of differences in population growth rates-which strongly
   cautions against using measured herbivory rates as a proxy for the
   impact of herbivores. Herbivory reduced plant population growth rates
   significantly more when potential growth rates were high, which helps to
   explain why there was less variation in actual population growth rates
   than in potential population growth rates. The synthesis of these
   studies also shows the need for future studies to report variance in
   estimates of lambda and to quantify how lambda varies as a function of

Abstract = {{Climate change can drive major shifts in community composition and
   interactions between resident species. However, the magnitude of these
   changes depends on the type of interactions and the biome in which they
   take place. We review the existing conceptual framework for how climate
   change will influence tropical plant-herbivore interactions and
   formalize a similar framework for the temperate zone. We then conduct
   the first biome-specific tests of how plant-herbivore interactions
   change in response to climate-driven changes in temperature,
   precipitation, ambient CO2, and ozone. We used quantitative
   meta-analysis to compare predicted and observed changes in experimental
   studies. Empirical studies were heavily biased toward temperate systems,
   so testing predicted changes in tropical plant-herbivore interactions
   was virtually impossible. Furthermore, most studies investigated the
   effects of CO2 with limited plant and herbivore species. Irrespective of
   location, most studies manipulated only one climate change factor
   despite the fact that different factors can act in synergy to alter
   responses of plants and herbivores. Finally, studies of belowground
   plant-herbivore interactions were also rare; those conducted suggest
   that climate change could have major effects on belowground subsystems.
   Our results suggest that there is a disconnection between the growing
   literature proposing how climate change will influence plant-herbivore
   interactions and the studies testing these predictions. General
   conclusions will also be hampered without better integration of
   above-and belowground systems, assessing the effects of multiple climate
   change factors simultaneously, and using greater diversity of species in

   stressful climate conditions including extreme high temperature (EHT)
   events; secondly, we conduct a meta-analysis of 30 studies providing 272
   cases of parasitism. Lower parasitism rates occurred in forest, citrus,
   cotton, corn, and rice, in contrast to high parasitism rates in
   vegetable crops. Trichogramma parasitism decreased with increasing
   absolute latitude, and was higher in regions with less climate
   seasonality in continents other than the Americas. The frequency of EHT
   events was negatively correlated with parasitism rates for all datasets

   maximum temperature was negatively correlated with parastism in corn,
   but positively correlated in vegetable crops. Both top-down and
   bottom-up factors could moderate the effect size of egg parasitoids over
   a range of EHT values. These patterns therefore suggest a complex

   anthropogenic noise. We gathered data from 36 studies, synthesizing
   information on more than 160 experiments and 60 bird and anuran species.
   To estimate the breadth of frequency shift, we calculated a standardized

   with typical frequency, body mass, experimental condition, and noise
   source type as independent terms. Our results reveal broader shifts in
   smaller bird species when compared with bigger species, an effect that

   Birds increased their dominant frequencies when confronted to

Title = {{Effects of grazing exclusion on carbon sequestration and plant diversity
   in grasslands of China A meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},

Abstract = {{Widespread land degradation has strengthened the urgent need to restore
   overgrazing grasslands. China has implemented the program Returning
   Grazing Land to Grassland' (RGLG) through grazing exclusion by fence
   since 2003. Despite a lot of field experiments, there is still
   controversy on the effects of grazing exclusion on rangeland
   restoration, highlighting the need for synthetic analysis. We conducted
   a meta analysis of 447 entries from 78 papers to analyze the
   spatiotemporal effects of grazing exclusion on plant diversity,
   productivity and soil carbon sequestration in the major RGLG-implemented
   provinces of China. Our results showed that, compared with the grazed
   sites, grazing exclusion significantly increased carbon stored in
   aboveground biomass, litter mass, belowground biomass and soils by
   84.7\%, 111.6\%, 25.5\% and 14.4\%, respectively. Plant coverage, soil
   available nitrogen, soil available phosphorus and soil microbial biomass
   carbon increased by 52.0\%, 21.7\% 22.8\% and 26.3\%, respectively.
   However, grazing exclusion had little effects on recovering plant
   diversity in China's grasslands. Of the factors examined, climatic
   factors strongly modified the effects of grazing exclusion on ecosystem
   carbon stocks, for example, precipitation significantly amplified the
   positive effects. Grazing exclusion played a positive role in soil
   carbon sequestration in most grassland types except in temperate
   desert-steppe. But annual soil carbon sequestration rates decayed
   rapidly over time in both alpine meadow and temperate steppe. Short-term
   (<5 years) grazing exclusion remarkably increased species richness, but
   not significantly in the long run. The threshold from neutral to
   negative effects of grazing exclusion on species evenness occurs after
   approximately ten years. Our findings provide evidence that grazing
   exclusion is an effective way to restore vegetation and sequestrate
   carbon in degraded grasslands, but not beneficial to plant diversity
   maintenance. The benefits of grazing exclusion are more effective in
   humid area than arid area. We suggest that grazing exclusion should be
   ceased after about six to ten years. Additionally, grazing exclusion
   should integrate with other appropriate management practices instead of
   operating on a stand-alone basis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Scale-specific spatial density dependence in parasitoids: a multi-factor

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1501-1510}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. Within a landscape, the risk of an insect being attacked by a
   parasitoid varies with the local density of the host species. This
   relationship should be strongest when observed at medium extents and
   resolutions with respect to parasitoids' foraging range, and turn
   negative at fine resolutions. The relationship is also hypothesized to
   depend on certain traits of the host and parasitoid taxa - for example
   being more positive for more specialized hosts or parasitoids and more
   negative for mobile hosts or gregarious parasitoids. Building on earlier
   literature reviews, it is now possible to investigate these hypotheses
   using meta-analysis.
   2. We performed a multi-factor meta-analysis on 151 analyses of
   parasitism rates with respect to host densities at specified scales,
   from 61 empirical studies published from 1988 to 2012. We explored how
   the correlation between host density and parasitism rate may be related
   to the explanatory variables already mentioned, plus parasitoid body
   length and various other characteristics of both hosts and parasitoids.
   3. Correlations (Pearson's r) between host density and parasitism rate
   ranged from -0.88 to 0.98 (mean 0.16, standard deviation 0.39). The
   correlation was more often negative where the host was exotic or in the
   orders Lepidoptera or Diptera, where the parasitoid was larger or
   exotic, or where the study was conducted at a finer grain size.
   Hymenoptera and Homoptera were the most likely host orders to reveal
   positive associations, with Coleoptera and Diptera intermediate.
   4. The fact that increased observational grain size had similar effects
   to decreased parasitoid body length could be taken as evidence that
   parasitoids' foraging ranges increase with their body length. However,
   the hypothesis about scale-specific foraging was not supported by
   studies that compared multiple scales.
   5. We conclude that parasitism most commonly produces positive
   (compensatory) spatial density dependence, but ecological context is
   all-important. These findings should help improve the design and
   interpretation of field experiments on parasitism as well as their
   application to the modelling of population dynamics and the practice of
   biological control.}},

Abstract = {{As the second largest carbon (C) flux between the atmosphere and
   terrestrial ecosystems, soil respiration (Rs) plays vital roles in
   regulating atmospheric CO2 concentration ({[}CO2]) and climatic dynamics
   in the earth system. Although numerous manipulative studies and a few
   meta-analyses have been conducted to determine the responses of Rs and
   its two components {[}i.e., autotrophic (Ra) and heterotrophic (Rh)
   respiration] to single global change factors, the interactive effects of
   the multiple factors are still unclear. In this study, we performed a
   meta-analysis of 150 multiple-factor (2) studies to examine the main and
   interactive effects of global change factors on Rs and its two
   components. Our results showed that elevated {[}CO2] (E), nitrogen
   addition (N), irrigation (I), and warming (W) induced significant
   increases in Rs by 28.6\%, 8.8\%, 9.7\%, and 7.1\%, respectively. The
   combined effects of the multiple factors, EN, EW, DE, IE, IN, IW, IEW,
   and DEW, were also significantly positive on Rs to a greater extent than
   those of the single-factor ones. For all the individual studies, the
   additive interactions were predominant on Rs (90.6\%) and its components
   (approximate to 70.0\%) relative to synergistic and antagonistic ones.
   However, the different combinations of global change factors (e.g., EN,
   NW, EW, IW) indicated that the three types of interactions were all
   important, with two combinations for synergistic effects, two for
   antagonistic, and five for additive when at least eight independent
   experiments were considered. In addition, the interactions of elevated
   {[}CO2] and warming had opposite effects on Ra and Rh, suggesting that
   different processes may influence their responses to the multifactor
   interactions. Our study highlights the crucial importance of the
   interactive effects among the multiple factors on Rs and its components,
   which could inform regional and global models to assess the
   climate-biosphere feedbacks and improve predictions of the future states
   of the ecological and climate systems.}},

Title = {{On the link between functional traits and growth rate: meta-analysis
   shows effects change with plant size, as predicted}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1488-1503}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A plant's growth rate is seen as a central element of its ecological
   strategy, and as determined by its traits. Yet the literature is
   inconsistent about the empirical correlation between functional traits
   and growth, casting doubt on the capacity of some prominent traits to
   influence growth rate.
   We propose that traits should influence growth in a way that depends on
   the size of individual plants. We outline mechanisms and hypotheses
   based on new theoretical work and test these predictions in tree species
   using a meta-analysis of 103 studies (>500 correlations) for five traits
   (specific leaf area, wood density, maximum height, seed mass and maximum
   assimilation rate). We also recorded data for 14 other traits commonly
   used in the trait literature. To capture the effects of plant size, we
   tested for a shift in the direction of correlation between growth rates
   and each trait across three ontogenetic stages: seedling, sapling and
   adult.
   Results were consistent with predictions, although there were some
   limitations arising from unequal numbers of observation across
   ontogenetic stages. Specific leaf area was correlated with relative
   growth rate in seedlings but not in adult plants. Correlations of growth
   with wood density were not affected by ontogenetic stage. Seed mass,
   assimilation rate and maximum height were correlated with relative
   growth rate only in one ontogenetic stage category: seedlings, seedlings
   and adults, respectively.
   Although we were able to confirm several of our theoretical predictions,
   major knowledge gaps still exist in the trait literature. For example,
   for one-third of the traits considered, the majority (>75\%) of reported
   correlations with growth came from the same ontogenetic stage.
   Synthesis. We show for some traits, how trait-growth correlations change
   in a predictable way with plant size. Our understanding of plant
   strategies should shift away from describing species as having a fixed
   growth strategy throughout their life (on a continuous axis from slow to
   fast growth), in favour of a size-dependent growth trajectories.}},

Abstract = {{Context The phenomenon of known as `land grabbing' is not a new process.
   Especially, since the 1990s, some capital-rich countries have started to
   buy or lease foreign lands to be able to produce food and biofuels.
   Objectives This article aimed at investigating the (un) sustainability
   of `transnational land deals' (TLDs) for investors, host governments and
   local communities. Given the three dimensions of sustainability, the
   ``social acceptability{''}, ``economic viability{''} and ``environmental
   conservation{''} of the TLDs have been studied.
   Methods To understand whether and to what extent the TLD is sustainable
   in each dimension a meta-analysis was conducted on 73 journal articles.
   Results Results showed that tenure arrangements and livelihoods were the
   main drivers for the matter's social acceptability. Accordingly, local
   communities are affected by losing and receiving little or no
   compensation for their land, and making them have to face the increasing
   vulnerability of their livelihoods. This results in a win-win-loss
   situation for investors, host governments and local communities,
   respectively. Economic (un) sustainability mainly depends on capital
   flow, infrastructure and employment. This aspect is evidenced as a win
   for investors and host governments and implies the aforementioned
   win-win-loss situation. The main aspects of environmental (un)
   sustainability are considered as biodiversity, ecosystem services, and
   climate change.
   Conclusions According to the results, both host governments and local
   communities experience loss. This results in a win-loss-loss status of
   the TLDs. The major challenge remains in establishing good land
   governance, which can guarantee the benefits to local people and their
   access to land.}},

Volume = {{230}},

Abstract = {{Agroforestry has been proposed as a sustainable agricultural system over
   conventional agriculture and forestry, conserving biodiversity and
   enhancing ecosystem service provision while not compromising
   productivity. However, the available evidence for the societal benefits
   of agroforestry is fragmented and does often not integrate diverse
   ecosystem services into the assessment. To upscale existing case-study
   insights to the European level, we conducted a meta-analysis on the
   effects of agroforestry on ecosystem service provision and on
   biodiversity levels. From 53 publications we extracted a total of 365
   comparisons that were selected for the meta-analysis. Results revealed
   an overall positive effect of agroforestry (effect size = 0.454, p <
   0.01) over conventional agriculture and forestry. However, results were
   heterogeneous, with differences among the types of agroforestry
   practices and ecosystem services assessed. Erosion control,
   biodiversity, and soil fertility are enhanced by agroforestry while
   there is no clear effect on provisioning services. The effect of
   agroforestry on biomass production is negative. Comparisons between
   agroforestry types and reference land-uses showed that both
   silvopastoral and silvoarable systems increase ecosystem service
   provision and biodiversity, especially when compared with forestry land.
   Mediterranean tree plantation systems should be especially targeted as
   soil erosion could be highly reduced while soil fertility increased. We
   conclude that agroforestry can enhance biodiversity and ecosystem
   service provision relative to conventional agriculture and forestry in
   Europe and could be a strategically beneficial land use in rural
   planning if its inherent complexity is considered in policy measures.

Abstract = {{Hundreds of single species studies have demonstrated the facility of
   silicon (Si) to alleviate diverse abiotic stresses in plants.
   Understanding of the mechanisms of Si-mediated stress alleviation is
   progressing, and several reviews have brought information together. A
   quantitative assessment of the alleviative capacity of Si, however,
   which could elucidate plant Si function more broadly, was lacking. We
   combined the results of 145 experiments, predominantly on agricultural
   species, in a meta-analysis to statistically assess the responses of
   stressed plants to Si supply across multiple plant families and abiotic
   stresses. We interrogated our database to determine whether stressed
   plants increased in dry mass and net assimilation rate, oxidative stress
   markers were reduced, antioxidant responses were increased and whether
   element uptake showed consistent changes when supplied with Si. We
   demonstrated that across plant families and stress types, Si increases
   dry weight, assimilation rate and chlorophyll biosynthesis and
   alleviates oxidative damage in stressed plants. In general, results
   indicated that plant family (as a proxy for accumulator type) and stress
   type had significant explanatory power for variation in responses. The
   consistent reduction in oxidative damage was not mirrored by consistent
   increases in antioxidant production, indicative of the several different
   stress alleviation mechanisms in which Si is involved. Silicon addition
   increased K in shoots, decreased As and Cd in roots and Na and Cd in
   shoots. Silicon addition did not affect Al, Ca or Mn concentration in
   shoots and roots of stressed plants. Plants had significantly lower
   concentrations of Si accumulated in shoots but not in roots when
   stressed. Meta-analyses showed consistent alleviation by Si of oxidative
   damage caused by a range of abiotic stresses across diverse species. Our
   findings indicate that Si is likely to be a useful fertilizer for many
   crops facing a spectrum of abiotic stresses. Similarities in responses
   across families provide strong support for a role of Si in the
   alleviation of abiotic stress in natural systems, where it has barely
   been explored. We suggest this role may become more important under a
   changing climate and more experiments using non-agricultural species are
   now needed.}},

Abstract = {{Biotic resistance is an important component to limiting the spread of
   invasive plants into native communities. However, under certain
   conditions native plants may also facilitate invasion, a process
   identified as biotic assistance. Identifying the conditions that
   associate with resistance and assistance is needed to better understand
   the factors driving species invasion.
   Substantial theory and empirical work suggests net effects of neighbors
   may be dependent upon habitat productivity and environmental conditions.
   How that applies to the interaction among the resident community and the
   invaders is largely untested. Here we compiled data from 23 articles,
   which had experimentally determined the strength of biotic resistance
   and/or assistance. We then combined these data with remote-sensing
   estimates of productivity, precipitation and temperature at each study
   site, Using standard meta-analytical techniques we determined the
   overall effect resident communities had on the emergence, growth,
   reproduction and survival of non-native invaders. Further, we tested
   whether the interaction between resident communities and invasive
   species was influenced by primary productivity, temperature and
   precipitation.
   Across all sites, we found broad support for biotic resistance, while
   evidence for biotic assistance was rare. However, we found the relative
   magnitude of biotic resistance on invaders increased with temperature or
   precipitation; a pattern consistent with the stress gradient hypothesis.
   In contrast we found no evidence that the strength of biotic resistance
   varied as a function of primary productivity. Further evaluation of the
   relationship between productivity and environmental conditions on the
   direction and strength of the effect of resident species on invaders may
   help predict invasion establishment and success. Understanding or
   predicting the susceptibility of communities to invasion may help
   prioritize management efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Biotic seed dispersal is a key process maintaining biodiversity in
   tropical forests where most trees produce vertebrate-dispersed seeds.
   Existing meta-analyses suggest an overall positive effect of vertebrate
   gut passage on seed germination, but no significant effects for
   non-flying mammals. However, previous meta-analyses combined rodents
   (seed predators) and primates (seed dispersers) into the non-flying
   mammals category, which may confound specific effects of each group on
   seed germination. However positive effects of monkeys on germination had
   previously been found in some studies. Here we disentangle the role of
   Neotropical primates as contributors to seed dispersal in tropical
   forests by running a meta-analysis to determine the overall magnitude of
   gut passage effects on seed germination percentage and mean time to
   germination. We also compare effect sizes as a function of different
   feeding guilds, gut complexities, and seed size. Our results show a
   strong, positive effect of primates on seed germination percentage and
   on the number of days to first germination. Strictly frugivorous
   monkeys, the group most threatened by extinction, showed the highest
   dispersal quality, increasing germination percentage by 75\%. Primates
   that include insects in their diets had no average effect on germination
   percentage or time. Gut passage had different outcomes on seeds with
   different sizes; both large and small seeds showed similar increases in
   germination percentages after gut passage, but only large seeds
   germinated faster than control seeds after gut passage. Our results show
   a relevant role for primates in providing high seed dispersal quality
   and as drivers of forest regeneration. The combined effects of
   defaunation and forest fragmentation may result in decreased
   regeneration of trees, which has the potential to affect negatively both
   forest structure and ecosystem processes. Finally, we provide general
   guidelines for standardizing research on seed dispersal by primates.}},

Abstract = {{Global climate models predict that future precipitation regimes will
   largely change across the globe due to the intensification of the global
   water cycle under climate warming, which may generate considerable
   impacts on ecosystem carbon (C) dynamics. Although substantial
   manipulative experiments have been conducted to probe the responses of
   ecosystem C processes to altered precipitation, how soil C storage
   responds to both drought and irrigation is still unclear across biomes
   and the globe. A meta-analysis of 179 published studies was carried out
   to examine responses of soil C storage and associated C fluxes and pools
   to drought and irrigation. Our results showed that, on average across
   all biomes, drought and irrigation similarly induced minor increases in
   soil C pool (SCP) by 1.45\% and 1.27\%, respectively. However, drought
   and irrigation oppositely affected both C fluxes and plant C pools as
   well as in agroecosystems (e.g., croplands and grasslands). The
   drought-induced increases in root: shoot ratio and decreases in
   heterotrophic respiration and soil C turnover rate mostly contributed to
   minor increase in SCP, while an increase in newly fixed C inputs in soil
   was more important under irrigation. In addition, the relative changes
   in precipitation intensity in manipulative experiments were positively
   correlated with response ratios of plant C pool (PCP), net primary
   production (NPP), microbial biomass C, ecosystem, soil and heterotrophic
   respiration. The drought-induced responses of SCP exhibited a positive
   correlation with experimental duration but not under irrigation and for
   other C pools and fluxes. These results indicate that more attention
   should be paid to the responses of C allocation and turnover rate to
   drought and irrigation, which should be incorporated into land surface
   models to better project effects of altered precipitation on ecosystem C
   cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Wild horse (Equus ferus caballus) management in western North America is
   an escalating concern for ecological integrity on these landscapes.
   Identifying potential diet overlap among horses, livestock, and wildlife
   will inform management decisions to optimize multiple interests. To
   understand dietary relationships, we conducted a quantitative synthesis
   of microhistological fecal studies for wild horse, beef cattle (Bos
   spp.), domestic sheep (Ovis aries), elk (Cervus elaphus), pronghorn
   (Antilocapra americana), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) diet
   composition on western rangelands of North America. Our search yielded
   60 studies from 14 states, 1 Canadian province, and 2 Mexican states
   with 392 unique species-season samples. We summarized plant species into
   graminoid, forb, and browse functional groups. For wild horses, seasonal
   diet composition means for graminoids (77-89\%), forbs (4-15\%), and
   browse (3-10\%) did not vary seasonally for any plant group (P <= 0.05).
   Univariate analyses and the calculation of effect sizes corroborated our
   finding that graminoid composition explained the potential overlap of
   wild horses with cattle regardless of season, with sheep and elk in the
   spring, with sheep in the summer, and with elk in the fall and winter.
   Although data indicate wild horse diets are primarily composed of
   graminoids, several studies reported unusual, regionally specific shifts
   in response to winter snow that limited graminoid accessibility, leading
   to higher browse composition. Season, plant composition, and ungulate
   assemblage may all influence dietary competition between wild horses and
   other large ungulate sharing western North American rangelands; however,
   the low and nonsignificant heterogeneity values at alpha 0.01 for
   cattle: horse effect size comparisons suggest that cattle and horses
   respond to regional and seasonal variation similarly-a result not
   observed for other ungulate: horse comparisons. Our meta-analysis
   provides a robust data set for evaluations of diet composition for wild
   horses, livestock, and wildlife, whereas no empirical studies have
   assessed all species together. (C) 2016 The Society for Range

Title = {{How much do phenotypic plasticity and local genetic variation contribute
   to phenotypic divergences along environmental gradients in widespread
   invasive plants? A meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{905-917}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{For introduced species that have spread across a wide distributional
   range, phenotypic plasticity (PLA) has often been proposed as an
   important contributor to invasion success, because it increases the
   survival rate during initial colonization. In contrast, local genetic
   variation (LOC) has also been proposed to be important, because it could
   allow invaders to evolve high performance in a new habitat. While
   evolutionary ecologists have long been interested in understanding
   genetic mechanisms that allow rapid colonization and spread of species,
   until recently experimental tests of these concepts have been limited.
   As a step towards generalization in our understanding of the importance
   of PLA and LOC, we review the current state of the literature on this
   topic using meta-analysis. Here, we focused on three fundamental
   questions: 1) which strategy, PLA or LOC, better explains the phenotypic
   divergences during invader range expansion across different
   environmental gradients? 2) Which species characteristics correlate with
   the occurrence of these different phenomena? And 3) does the detection
   of PLA versus LOC depend on the trait studied? Using meta-analysis we
   found that plasticity explained a higher proportion of phenotypic
   variation regardless of the environmental gradients studied or plant
   growth forms. PLA predominated in clonal, self-compatible and perennial
   species, while LOC predominated in annual species. The patterns were
   trait-dependent: LOC was significantly more important than PLA in
   phenology, while opposite patterns were found in fecundity and biomass
   allocation. The frequent simultaneous detection of PLA and genotypic
   variation in PLA among invasive populations suggested that PLA might
   benefit from LOC to some extent. Our results also indicate that the
   contribution of plasticity to the competitive advantages of invasive
   plants may be more informative than the level of plasticity itself.}},

Title = {{Does primary productivity modulate the indirect effects of large

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Indirect effects of large mammalian herbivores (LMH), while much less
   studied than those of apex predators, are increasingly recognized to
   exert powerful influences on communities and ecosystems. The strength of
   these effects is spatiotemporally variable, and several sets of authors
   have suggested that they are governed in part by primary productivity.
   However, prior theoretical and field studies have generated conflicting
   results and predictions, underscoring the need for a synthetic global
   analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis of the direction and magnitude of
   large mammalian herbivore-initiated indirect interactions using 67
   published studies comprising 456 individual responses. We georeferenced
   41 of these studies (comprising 253 responses from 33 locations on five
   continents) to a satellite-derived map of primary productivity. Because
   predator assemblages might also influence the impact of large
   herbivores, we conducted a similar analysis using a global map of large
   carnivore species richness. In general, LMH reduced the abundance of
   other consumer species and also tended to reduce consumer richness,
   although the latter effect was only marginally significant. There was a
   pronounced reduction in the strength of negative (i.e. suppressive, due
   e.g., to competition) indirect effects of LMH on consumer abundance in
   more productive ecosystems. In contrast, positive (facilitative)
   indirect effects were not significantly correlated with productivity,
   likely because these comprised a more heterogeneous array of mechanisms.
   We found no effect of carnivore species richness on herbivore-initiated
   indirect effect strength. Our findings help to resolve the fundamental
   problem of ecological contingency as it pertains to the strength of an
   understudied class of multitrophic interactions. Moreover, these results
   will aid in predicting the indirect effects of anthropogenic wildlife
   declines and irruptions, and how these effects might be mediated by
   climatically driven shifts in resource availability. To the extent that
   intact ungulate guilds help to suppress populations of small animals
   that act as agricultural pests and disease reservoirs, the negative
   impacts of large mammal declines on human well-being may be relatively
   stronger in low-productivity areas.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the first quantitative meta-analysis of the
   non-market valuation literature on the external effects associated with
   wind power production. A data set of 60 observations drawn from 32
   studies is constructed. The relative economic values of different types

   sample characteristics on welfare estimates are examined. The results
   indicate a significant effect of visual externalities on welfare
   estimates in both directions, i.e., a positive effect of visual
   improvements and a negative effect of deteriorations. This finding
   corresponds to predictions of the importance of visual impacts in the
   social science literature. External effects of wind power on
   biodiversity (mainly birds) do not affect welfare estimates. Indirect
   externalities caused by conventional sources of electricity that can be
   avoided by wind power, such as a the reduction of air pollution, do
   neither have a significant impact on welfare measures. Methodologically,
   we find substantial but inelastic income effects and, for choice
   experiments, clear evidence of sensitivity to scope. From a policy point

Title = {{Home-field advantage? evidence of local adaptation among plants, soil,
   and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi through meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Local adaptation, the differential success of genotypes in
   their native versus foreign environment, arises from various
   evolutionary processes, but the importance of concurrent abiotic and
   biotic factors as drivers of local adaptation has only recently been
   investigated. Local adaptation to biotic interactions may be
   particularly important for plants, as they associate with microbial
   symbionts that can significantly affect their fitness and may enable
   rapid evolution. The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is ideal for
   investigations of local adaptation because it is globally widespread
   among most plant taxa and can significantly affect plant growth and
   fitness. Using meta- analysis on 1170 studies (from 139 papers), we
   investigated the potential for local adaptation to shape plant growth
   responses to arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation.
   Results: The magnitude and direction for mean effect size of mycorrhizal
   inoculation on host biomass depended on the geographic origin of the
   soil and symbiotic partners. Sympatric combinations of plants, AM fungi,
   and soil yielded large increases in host biomass compared to when all
   three components were allopatric. The origin of either the fungi or the
   plant relative to the soil was important for explaining the effect of AM
   inoculation on plant biomass. If plant and soil were sympatric but
   allopatric to the fungus, the positive effect of AM inoculation was much
   greater than when all three components were allopatric, suggesting
   potential local adaptation of the plant to the soil; however, if fungus
   and soil were sympatric (but allopatric to the plant) the effect of AM
   inoculation was indistinct from that of any allopatric combinations,
   indicating maladaptation of the fungus to the soil.
   Conclusions: This study underscores the potential to detect local
   adaptation for mycorrhizal relationships across a broad swath of the
   literature. Geographic origin of plants relative to the origin of AM
   fungal communities and soil is important for describing the effect of
   mycorrhizal inoculation on plant biomass, suggesting that local
   adaptation represents a powerful factor for the establishment of novel
   combinations of fungi, plants, and soils. These results highlight the
   need for subsequent investigations of local adaptation in the
   mycorrhizal symbiosis and emphasize the importance of routinely
   considering the origin of plant, soil, and fungal components.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely thought that small populations should have less additive
   genetic variance and respond less efficiently to natural selection than
   large populations. Across taxa, we meta-analytically quantified the
   relationship between adult census population size (N) and additive
   genetic variance (proxy: h(2)) and found no reduction in h(2) with
   decreasing N; surveyed populations ranged from four to one million
   individuals (1735 h(2) estimates, 146 populations, 83 species). In terms
   of adaptation, ecological conditions may systematically differ between
   populations of varying N; the magnitude of selection these populations
   experience may therefore also differ. We thus also meta-analytically
   tested whether selection changes with N and found little evidence for
   systematic differences in the strength, direction or form of selection
   with N across different trait types and taxa (7344 selection estimates,
   172 populations, 80 species). Collectively, our results (i) indirectly
   suggest that genetic drift neither overwhelms selection more in small
   than in large natural populations, nor weakens adaptive potential/h(2)
   in small populations, and (ii) imply that natural populations of varying
   sizes experience a variety of environmental conditions, without
   consistently differing habitat quality at small N. However, we caution
   that the data are currently insufficient to determine whether some small
   populations may retain adaptive potential definitively. Further study is
   required into (i) selection and genetic variation in completely isolated
   populations of known N, under-represented taxonomic groups, and
   nongeneralist species, (ii) adaptive potential using multidimensional
   approaches and (iii) the nature of selective pressures for specific

Abstract = {{AimTerrestrial invertebrates comprise a large proportion of alien
   species world-wide, yet a quantitative global synthesis of their effects
   on native species and ecosystems has not been explored. We conducted a
   meta-analysis to examine the ecological impacts of terrestrial
   invertebrate invaders and to test how impacts are modulated by the
   invader's trophic position, habitat attributes (i.e. insularity and
   disturbance) and the study methodology (observational versus
   experimental).
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe investigated the effects of terrestrial invertebrate invaders
   on populations, communities and ecosystems by conducting a random
   effects meta-analysis using 112 articles reporting data from 710 field
   and laboratory studies. The analysis included 16 insect, 11 earthworm, 7
   slug and 1 nematode invaders.
   ResultsOn average, across invaders, the presence of invaders reduced
   plant fitness (52\%), animal diversity (33\%) and animal abundance
   (29\%). Leaf litter decomposition was 41\% higher in the presence of
   invaders, while other ecosystem-level variables such as nutrient cycling
   were not affected in a consistent direction. Invasive predators and
   detritivores decreased animal abundance, whereas herbivores and
   omnivores had limited impacts. Single invaders increased soil nitrogen
   pools while multiple species did not. Insularity and disturbance did not
   affect the magnitude of the impacts significantly, mainly because there
   was a large variation among studies.
   Main conclusionsOverall, our study indicates that terrestrial
   invertebrate invaders have significant consistent effects on
   populations, communities and ecosystems, with islands and disturbed
   sites not being more prone to impacts. However, effects vary
   considerably depending on the type of impact being examined and the
   trophic position of the invader. There is no evidence that invaders
   cause larger impacts when multiple species of invaders, rather than
   single invaders, are involved.}},

Abstract = {{A growing number of studies indicate high conservation potential of

   diversity. Species richness of individual pools was associated with
   habitat type (spoil heap vs. mine subsidence) and with several habitat
   variables, in particular the character of vegetation around aquatic
   habitats. In conclusion, the results indicate that diversity and species
   composition are significantly influenced by factors reflecting the
   formation and subsequent succession of pools. Effective conservation
   management should concentrate primarily on modifying pools' initial
   properties such as bottom substrate. Subsequent management should then
   sustain landscape dynamics, which means in particular to sustain minor
   disturbances that subsequently affect vegetation succession and prevent
   excessive overgrowing of expansive vegetation, as doing so is promoting
   the habitat heterogeneity which is essential to high biodiversity in
   these areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidative stress (OS) as a proximate mechanism for life-history
   trade-offs is widespread in the literature. One such resource allocation
   trade-off involves growth rate, and theory suggests that OS might act as
   both a constraint on and a cost of growth, yet studies investigating
   this have produced conflicting results. Here, we use meta-analysis to
   investigate whether increased OS levels impact on growth (OS as a
   constraint on growth) and whether greater growth rates can increase OS
   (OS as a cost of growth). The role of OS as a constraint on growth was
   supported by the meta-analysis. Greater OS, in terms of either increased
   damage or reduced levels of antioxidants, was associated with reduced
   growth although the effect depended on the experimental manipulation
   used. Our results also support an oxidative cost of growth, at least in
   terms of increased oxidative damage, although faster growth was not
   associated with a change in antioxidant levels. These findings that OS
   can act as a constraint on growth support theoretical links between OS
   and animal life histories and provide evidence for a
   growth-self-maintenance trade-off. Furthermore, the apparent oxidative
   costs of growth imply individuals cannot alter this trade-off when faced
   with enhanced growth. We offer a starting platform for future research
   and recommend the use of oxidative damage biomarkers in nonlethal tissue
   to investigate the growth-OS relationship further.}},

Abstract = {{Water and nitrogen (N) are two key limiting factors for citrus
   production. Reported effects of water and N inputs on citrus yield,
   water use efficiency (WUE) and N use efficiency (NUE) vary greatly,
   mainly due to differences in cultivars, tree age, climate, soil types,
   and water and N input levels. So far, no systematic analysis has been
   performed, and as a result, the interactive effects of water and N
   inputs on yield, WUE and NUE of citrus orchards are unknown. Also, gaps
   between attainable and actual yields, WUE and NUE have not been
   established yet. Here, we report on a global meta-analysis of yields,
   WUE and NUE of citrus production systems, using 1009 observations from
   55 studies, conducted in 11 countries. Median citrus yields ranged from
   30 to 60 t ha(-1), which were in between average global yields (range
   10-30 t ha(-1)) and attainable yields (range 60-90 t ha(-1)). Median WUE
   ranged from 2.5 to 5 kg m(-3) and median NUE from 150 to 350 kg kg(-1).
   Citrus yields were related to water and N inputs and tree age.
   Relationships between water and N inputs and yield, WUE and NUE were
   also analysed for sub-datasets and quantiles, to examine the
   relationships near the extremes. There were statistical significant
   interactions between water and N inputs in yield and NUE, but not in
   WUE. This indicates that studies aiming at the optimization of water and
   N inputs must consider interactions and optimize water and N inputs
   simultaneously. Based on our analyses, we estimated that reducing
   over-optimal irrigation to optimal irrigation may increase citrus yield
   by 20\%, WUE by 30\% and NUE by 15\%. Similarly, reducing over-optimal N
   fertilization to optimal N fertilization may increase yield by 10\%, WUE
   by 15\% dnd NUE by 40\%. We concluded that there is room for a
   significant increase in yield, WUE and NUE through the simultaneous
   optimization of water and fertilizer N inputs via precision fertigation.

Abstract = {{To maintain the high biodiversity of semi-natural grasslands, management
   by grazing or mowing is needed. Given the limited resources and few

   only a few studies comparing the effects of mowing and grazing on

   mowing on outcomes relevant for biodiversity conservation. We identified
   35 relevant studies on grazing and annual mowing that provided data
   suitable for the meta-analysis. We found that grazing generally had a
   more positive effect on the conservation value of semi-natural
   grasslands compared to mowing, but effect sizes were generally small to
   moderate for most contrasts. Furthermore, effects varied across some
   grassland characteristics e.g. for different grassland types, with
   grazing and mowing having a similar effect or mowing having a more
   positive effect in certain cases. Our results suggest, that in most

Abstract = {{Predator-prey interactions are often studied entirely within the
   ecosystem of the predator. However, many prey transition between
   ecosystems during development, expanding the effects of predators across
   ecosystems. Prey are often vulnerable to predation during this
   transition, facing a predator gauntlet as they leave their source
   ecosystem. As a result of predation during this transition, predators
   may have stronger effects on prey fluxes to the neighboring ecosystem
   than on prey densities in the predator's own ecosystem. I used
   meta-analysis of predator (fish) and prey (invertebrate) interactions in
   freshwater ecosystems to test the hypothesis that fish have stronger
   effects on prey flux to the terrestrial ecosystem, by reducing insect
   emergence biomass, than on prey densities in the aquatic ecosystem, by
   reducing benthic insect/invertebrate biomass. Fish reduced insect
   emergence by 39 \% on average, more than twice as strong as their
   reductions of benthic prey (16 \% reduction; averages are
   variance-weighted). In fact, fish effects on benthic prey were not
   significantly different from zero, but were significant for emergence.
   These results indicate that predator effects can not only cascade from
   one ecosystem to another but also that effects can be stronger outside
   than within the ecosystem of the predator. Failure to account for this
   may underestimate the effects of predators on prey.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands occupy about 40\% of the world's land surface and store
   approximately 10\% of the global soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. This
   SOC pool, in which a larger proportion is held in the topsoil (0-0.3
   in), is strongly influenced by grassland management. Despite this, it is
   not yet fully understood how grassland SOC stocks respond to
   degradation, particularly for the different environmental conditions
   found globally. The objective of this review was to elucidate the impact
   of grassland degradation on changes in SOC stocks and the main
   environmental controls, worldwide, as a prerequisite for rehabilitation.
   A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted using 55 studies with 628
   soil profiles under temperate, humid, sub-humid, tropical and semi-arid
   conditions, to compare SOC stocks in the topsoil of non degraded and
   degraded grassland soils. Grassland degradation significantly reduced
   SOC stocks by 16\% in dry climates (<600 mm) compared to 8\% in wet
   climates (>1000 mm) and Asia was the most affected continent (-23.7\%).
   Moreover, the depletion of SOC stock induced by degradation was more
   pronounced in sandy (<20\% clay) soils with a high SOC depletion of 10\%
   compared to 1\% in clayey (>= 32\% clay) soils. Furthermore, grassland
   degradation significantly reduced SOC by 14\% in acidic soils (pH <= 5),
   while SOC changes were negligible for higher pH. Assuming that 30\% of
   grasslands worldwide are degraded, the amount of SOC likely to be lost
   would be 4.05 Gt C, with a 95\% confidence between 1.8 and 6.3 Gt C

Abstract = {{Selectively logged tropical forests retain high species richness and

   Borneo, which have suffered some of the most intense selective logging
   in the tropics. We found that species classified by the International

   `near-threatened' are generally less abundant in logged tropical forests
   than those classified as `least concern'. However, the effect of logging
   within each IUCN category is variable, indicating that logging is not

   that closely related species responded similarly to. logging, in birds
   there was significant variation between responses of some closely
   related species. Bigger species were significantly more susceptible to
   logging than smaller species in both birds and mammals. We also found

Abstract = {{The use of functional traits to characterize community composition has

   environment interactions; yet such effect traits are still poorly
   included in trait based approaches. Given their key trophic position in
   aquatic ecosystems, individual zooplankton affect energy fluxes and
   elemental processing. We compiled a large database of zooplankton traits
   contributing to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycling and examined
   the effect of classification and habitat (marine vs. freshwater) on
   trait relationships. Respiration and nutrient excretion rates followed
   mass dependent scaling in both habitats, with exponents ranging from
   0.70 to 0.90. Our analyses revealed surprising differences in allometry

   length-specific mass and three times higher mass specific respiration
   rates. These differences in traits point to implications for ecological

Abstract = {{No-till (NT) practices are among promising options toward adaptation and
   mitigation of climate change. However, the mitigation effectiveness of
   NT depends not only on its carbon sequestration potential but also on
   soil-derived CH4 and N2O emissions. A meta-analysis was conducted, using
   a dataset involving 136 comparisons from 39 studies in China, to
   identify site-specific factors which influence CH4 emission, CH4 uptake,
   and N2O emission under NT. Comparative treatments involved NT without
   residue retention (NT0), NT with residue retention (NTR), compared to
   plow tillage (PT) with residue removed (PT0). Overall, NT0 significantly
   decreased CH4 emission by similar to 30\% (P<0.05) compared to PT0 with
   an average emission 218.8kgha(-1) for rice paddies. However, the
   increase in N2O emission could partly offset the benefits of the
   decrease in CH4 emission under NT compared to PT0. NTR significantly
   enhanced N2O emission by 82.1\%, 25.5\%, and 20.8\% (P<0.05) compared to
   PT0 for rice paddies, acid soils, and the first 5years of the

   indicated that the higher N2O emission could be mitigated by adopting NT
   within alkaline soils, for long-term duration, and with less N
   fertilization input when compared to PT0. In addition, the natural log
   (lnR) of response ratio of CH4 and N2O emissions under NT correlated
   positively (enhancing emission) with climate factors (temperature and
   precipitation) and negatively (reducing emission) with experimental
   duration, suggesting that avoiding excess soil wetness and using NT for
   a long term could enhance the benefits of NT. Therefore, a thorough
   understanding of the conditions favoring greenhouse gas(es) reductions

Title = {{Which landscape size best predicts the influence of forest cover on
   restoration success? A global meta-analysis on the scale of effect}},

Abstract = {{Landscape context is a strong predictor of species persistence,
   abundance and distribution, yet its influence on the success of
   ecological restoration remains unclear. Thus, a primary question arises:
   which landscape size best predicts the effects of forest cover on
   restoration success? To answer this question, we conducted a global
   meta-analysis for biodiversity (mammals, birds, invertebrates,
   herpetofauna and plants) and measures of vegetation structure (cover,
   density, height, biomass and litter). Response ratios were calculated
   for comparisons between reference (e.g. old-growth forest) and disturbed
   sites (degraded or restored). Using an information-theoretic approach,
   mean response ratio (restoration success) and response ratio variance
   (restoration predictability) within each study landscape were regressed
   against the percentage of overall (summed forest cover) and contiguous
   (summed pixels of 60\% forest cover) forest within eight different
   buffer sizes of radius 5-200km (at 1-km resolution). We included 247
   studies encompassing 196 study landscapes and 4360 quantitative
   comparisons. The best buffer (landscape) size varied for the following:
   (i) overall and contiguous forest cover, (ii) biodiversity and
   vegetation structure and (iii) mean response ratio and response ratio
   variance. Only plant biodiversity was influenced by overall forest cover
   (buffer size of 5, 10 and 200km radii), while plants (10 and 200km
   radii), mammals (5, 10 and 50-200km radii), invertebrates (5 and 10km
   radii), cover (5km radii), height (5km radii) and litter (100km radii)
   were influenced by contiguous forest cover. Overall, mean response ratio
   and response ratio variance were positively and negatively nonlinearly
   related with both overall and contiguous forest cover, respectively. We
   reveal for the first time a clear pattern of increasing restoration
   success and decreasing uncertainty as contiguous forest cover increases.
   We also indicate preliminary recommended buffer sizes for investigating
   landscape restoration effects on biodiversity and vegetation structure.
   However, the coarse grain and variability in the data mean the optimal
   landscape size may not have been detected; thus, further research is
   needed.Synthesis and applications. When setting targets for ecological
   restoration, policymakers and restoration practitioners should account
   for the following: (i) the landscape context, particularly the amount of
   contiguous habitat up to 10km around a disturbed site, and (ii) the
   uncertainty in restoration success, as it increases when contiguous
   forest cover falls below about 50\%.

Title = {{Are global warming and ocean acidification conspiring against marine

   temperature, high CO2 and their interaction}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR 23}},
Abstract = {{With the occurrence of global change, research aimed at estimating the
   performance of marine ectotherms in a warmer and acidified future has
   intensified. The concept of oxygen- and capacity-limited thermal
   tolerance, which is inspired by the Fry paradigm of a bell-shaped
   increase-optimum-decrease-type response of aerobic scope to increasing
   temperature, but also includes proposed negative and synergistic effects
   of elevated CO2 levels, has been suggested as a unifying framework. The
   objectives of this meta-analysis were to assess the following: (i) the
   generality of a bell-shaped relationship between absolute aerobic scope
   (AAS) and temperature; (ii) to what extent elevated CO2 affects resting
   oxygen uptake MO2rest and AAS; and (iii) whether there is an interaction
   between elevated temperature and CO2. The behavioural effects of CO2 are
   also briefly discussed. In 31 out of 73 data sets (both acutely exposed
   and acclimated), AAS increased and remained above 90\% of the maximum,
   whereas a clear thermal optimum was observed in the remaining 42 data
   sets. Carbon dioxide caused a significant rise in MO2rest in only 18 out
   of 125 data sets, and a decrease in 25, whereas it caused a decrease in
   AAS in four out of 18 data sets and an increase in two. The analysis did
   not reveal clear evidence for an overall correlation with temperature,
   CO2 regime or duration of CO2 treatment. When CO2 had an effect,
   additive rather than synergistic interactions with temperature were most
   common and, interestingly, they even interacted antagonistically on
   MO2rest and AAS. The behavioural effects of CO2 could complicate
   experimental determination of respiratory performance. Overall, this
   meta-analysis reveals heterogeneity in the responses to elevated
   temperature and CO2 that is not in accordance with the idea of a single
   unifying principle and which cannot be ignored in attempts to model and
   predict the impacts of global warming and ocean acidification on marine
   ectotherms.}},

Abstract = {{Many species have isolated, inbred populations that have a high risk of
   extinction from inbreeding depression. While inbreeding can be reversed
   by outcrossing (genetic rescue), doubts have been expressed about
   whether fitness benefits persist beyond the F1 generation. To address
   this issue, I used a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of
   outcrossing of inbred populations on reproductive fitness in F1, F2 and
   F3 (and later) generations for population crosses screened as having a
   low risk of outbreeding depression. Outcrossing of inbred populations
   was significantly beneficial compared to the inbred parent in the F1, F2
   and F3 (and later) generations, with 90.5\%, 100\% and 94.1\% of
   comparisons beneficial, respectively. The median benefits of outcrossing
   on composite fitness (combined fecundity and survival) were 42\%, 84\%
   and 86\% in the F1, F2 and F3 generations, respectively, and F2 and F3
   effects were not significantly different from those in the F1. Further,
   pre-screening to detect possible outbreeding depression was highly
   effective. Consequently, outcrossing can be recommended to genetically
   rescue inbred populations, provided the risk of outbreeding depression
   has been assessed and found to be low. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Although invasive plants are a major source of terrestrial ecosystem
   degradation worldwide, it remains unclear which trophic levels above the
   base of the food web are most vulnerable to plant invasions. We
   performed a meta-analysis of 38 independent studies from 32 papers to
   examine how invasive plants alter major groupings of primary and
   secondary consumers in three globally distributed ecosystems: wetlands,
   woodlands and grasslands. Within each ecosystem we examined if green
   (grazing) food webs are more sensitive to plant invasions compared to
   brown (detrital) food webs. Invasive plants have strong negative effects
   on primary consumers (detritivores, bacterivores, fungivores, and/or
   herbivores) in woodlands and wetlands, which become less abundant in
   both green and brown food webs in woodlands and green webs in wetlands.
   Plant invasions increased abundances of secondary consumers (predators
   and/or parasitoids) only in woodland brown food webs and green webs in
   wetlands. Effects of invasive plants on grazing and detrital food webs
   clearly differed between ecosystems. Overall, invasive plants had the
   most pronounced effects on the trophic structure of wetlands and

Abstract = {{The vertebrate stress response has been shown to suppress investment in
   reproductive and immune function and may also lead to a reduced
   investment in the production of secondary sexual traits. However, it has
   been difficult to model roles of stress in sexual selection due to the
   inconsistent results seen in empirical studies testing for the effect of
   stress on the expression of secondary sexual traits. We conducted a
   phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of published associations
   between physiological correlates of stress and sexual signaling in
   vertebrates in order to identify any consistent patterns. Our analysis
   included signaling in both males and females, 4 stress measures, and 4
   categories of sexually selected traits (vocalizations, traits that
   varied in size, traits that varied in coloration, and opposite-sex
   preference). Across 38 studies of 26 species, there was no significant
   relationship between physiological correlates of stress and the
   expression of sexual signals. Mean effect size, however, varied
   significantly across the 4 types of sexually selected trait. We propose
   development of a model that incorporates the nuanced effects of species
   ecology, trait type, ecological context, and the complex nature of the
   physiological stress response, on the expression of sexually selected

Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{594-604}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Here we synthesize empirical research using meta-analysis to compare how
   consumer and resource fluxes affect recipient food webs. We tested the
   following hypotheses: (H-1) The direct effects of resource fluxes
   (bottom-up) should be stronger than the direct effects of consumer
   fluxes (top-down), because resource fluxes are permanent (do not return
   to the food web in which they were produced) but consumer fluxes may not
   be (consumers can leave). (H-2) Following H-1, the indirect effects
   should attenuate (weaken) more quickly for consumer fluxes than for
   resource fluxes due to their direct effects being weaker. (H-3) The
   effects of resource fluxes should be stronger when recipient food webs
   are in different ecosystems than donor food webs due to differences in
   elevation that accompany cross-ecosystem food web interfaces, often
   increasing flux quantity due to gravity, while the effects of consumer
   fluxes should be stronger when donor and recipient food webs are in the
   same ecosystem as they should more easily assimilate into the recipient
   food web. We found no differences in the magnitude of bottom-up and
   top-down direct effects for resource and consumer fluxes, but top-down
   direct effects were 122\% stronger than top-down indirect effects.
   Indirect effects of prey and predator fluxes quickly attenuated while
   indirect effects of non-prey resource and herbivore fluxes did not, as
   the overall direct effects of prey and predator fluxes were 123\% and
   163\% stronger than their indirect effects, respectively. This result
   suggests that the magnitude of indirect effects decrease as the trophic
   level of resource and consumer fluxes increases, and also contrasts with
   results from studies showing in situ top-down indirect effects are
   stronger than in situ bottom-up indirect effects. We found that resource
   and consumer flux effect sizes were similar when they occurred between
   ecosystems, but when they occurred within ecosystems predator flux
   effects were 107\% stronger than nutrient flux effects. Finally, we
   found that observational studies had higher effect sizes than
   manipulative studies. Future research should focus on how resource and
   consumer fluxes might interact and generate feedbacks in empirical
   studies of natural food webs, and what ecological factors might affect
   their relative strength.}},

   generation of random-effects sizes for Hedges' d, log response ratio,
   odds ratio and correlation coefficients for Monte Carlo experiments;
   covariance equations for modelling dependencies among multiple effect
   sizes (e.g. with a common control, phylogenetic correlations); and

Abstract = {{The evolution of defensive traits and strategies depends on the
   intensity of selection imposed by natural enemies and on the fitness
   costs of defenses against these enemies. We tested several hypotheses
   about the evolution of chemical defenses in plant-feeding insects using
   a meta-analysis. We analyzed the effectiveness (in terms of prey
   survival; 159 publications) and costs (in terms of reduction in
   performance due to defense production; 33 publications) of chemical
   defenses in various prey-predator systems (140 herbivore species and 124
   enemy species). The chemical defenses of insect herbivores, on average,
   were effective against generalist predators, were not effective against
   specialist predators and generalist parasitoids, and increased the risk
   of parasitism by specialist parasitoids. The defenses were more
   effective against vertebrate than against invertebrate predators and
   most effective against birds. Defensive compounds synthesized de novo
   and derived from the herbivore's food plants did not differ in the
   magnitude of their effects. Externalization of chemical defenses
   enhanced their effects on naive vertebrate predators but simultaneously
   increased the risk of parasitism. The defenses of specialist herbivores
   were more effective than those of generalists, mostly due to species
   that sequestered plant allelochemicals for their own defenses.
   Advertising of chemical defenses by warning display enhanced their
   effectiveness only against vertebrate predators. Aposematic colors and
   patterns were more effective warning signals than other types of
   conspicuous coloration against both experienced and naive vertebrate
   predators, suggesting that certain colors and/or patterns were more
   important than conspicuousness for both learning and innate avoidance.
   The meta-analysis did not reveal physiological costs of the production
   of chemical defenses across 22 herbivore species, although the results
   varied strongly with the method used to measure these costs. We conclude
   that the cost-benefit trade-offs driving the evolution of chemical
   defenses in herbivorous insects are affected by ecological costs (i.e.,
   increased susceptibility to parasitoids) more than by costs in terms of
   resources. Still, a favorable cost-benefit ratio, i.e., great effects
   for a small expenditure, may partly explain the prevalence of chemical
   anti-predator defenses in insects.}},

   Recent studies have investigated the relationships between plant
   diversity and arthropod communities at the landscape scale, but few have
   done so at the local scale. We conducted a meta-analysis of 32 papers
   containing 175 independent measures of the relationship between plant
   diversity and arthropod communities. We found that generalist predators
   had a strong positive response to plant diversity, that is, their
   abundance increased as plant diversity increased. Herbivores, in
   contrast, had an overall weak and negative response to plant diversity.
   However, specialist and generalist herbivores differed in their response
   to plant diversity, that is, the response was negative for specialists
   and not significant for generalists. While the effects of scale remain
   unclear, the response to plant diversity tended to increase for
   specialist herbivores, but decrease for generalist herbivores as the
   scale increased. There was no clear effect of scale on the response of
   generalist predators to plant diversity. Our results suggest that the
   response of herbivores to plant diversity at the local scale is a
   balance between habitat and trophic effects that vary according to
   arthropod specialization and habitat type. Synthesis and applications.
   Positive effects of plant diversity on generalist predators confirm
   that, at the local scale, plant diversification of agroecosystems is a
   credible and promising option for increasing pest regulation. Results
   from our meta-analysis suggest that natural control in plant-diversified
   systems is more likely to occur for specialist than for generalist
   herbivores. In terms of pest management, our results indicate that
   small-scale plant diversification (via the planting of cover crops or
   intercrops and reduced weed management) is likely to increase the
   control of specialist herbivores by generalist predators.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), either individually or in combination,
   have been demonstrated to limit biomass production in terrestrial
   ecosystems. Field studies have been extensively synthesized to assess
   global patterns of N impacts on terrestrial ecosystem processes.
   However, to our knowledge, no synthesis has been done so far to reveal
   global patterns of P impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, especially under
   different nitrogen (N) levels. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of
   impacts of P addition, either alone or with N addition, on aboveground
   (AGB) and belowground biomass production (BGB), plant and soil P
   concentrations, and N:P ratio in terrestrial ecosystems. Overall, our
   meta-analysis quantitatively confirmed existing notions: (i)
   colimitation of N and P on biomass production and (ii)more P limitation
   in tropical forest than other ecosystems. More importantly, our analysis
   revealed new findings: (i) P limitation on biomass production was
   aggravated by N enrichment and (ii) plant P concentration was a better
   indicator of P limitation than soil P availability. Specifically, P
   addition increased AGB and BGB by 34\% and 13\%, respectively. The
   effect size of P addition on biomass production was larger in tropical
   forest than grassland, wetland, and tundra and varied with P fertilizer
   forms, P addition rates, or experimental durations. The P-induced
   increase in biomass production and plant P concentration was larger
   under elevated than ambient N. Our findings suggest that the global
   limitation of P on biomass production will become severer under
   increasing N fertilizer and deposition in the future.}},

   assess the consistency of cetacean responses to whale-watching vessels
   across a pool of suitable studies covering a variety of species and

   responses and to explore their reliability across species. We found
   disruptions of activity budget and of path directionality as the most
   consistent responses towards whale-watching vessels. In a similar manner
   across species, animals were more likely to travel and less likely to
   rest and forage in the presence of vessels. Cetaceans also showed a
   tendency to increase path sinuosity (deviation index) and decrease path
   linearity (directness index) during boat interactions. We also explored
   the influence of socio-ecological factors on behavioral response but
   found no consistent results among studies. Further population-specific

   conducted using 46 peer-reviewed publications totaling 174 paired
   observations comparing CO2 emissions over entire seasons or years from
   tilled and untilled soils across different climates, crop types and soil
   conditions with the objective of quantifying tillage impact on CO2
   emissions and assessing the main controls. On average, tilled soils
   emitted 21aEuro-\% more CO2 than untilled soils, which corresponded to a
   significant difference at P < 0.05. The difference increased to
   29aEuro-\% in sandy soils from arid climates with low soil organic
   carbon content (SOC(C)aEuro-< aEuro-1aEuro-\%) and low soil moisture,
   but tillage had no impact on CO2 fluxes in clayey soils with high
   background SOCC (> aEuro-3aEuro-\%). Finally, nitrogen fertilization and
   crop residue management had little effect on the CO2 responses of soils

Abstract = {{The Water Framework Directive (WFD) is arguably the most ambitious piece
   of European Union (EU) legislation in the field of water. The directive
   defines a general framework for integrated river basin management in
   Europe with a view to achieving ``good water status{''} by 2015.
   Institutional novelties include, among others, water management at
   hydrological scales, the involvement of nonstate actors in water
   planning, and various economic principles, as well as a common strategy
   to support EU member states during the implementation of the directive.
   More than 15 years after the adoption of the WFD, and with the passing
   of an important milestone, 2015, we believe it is time for an interim
   assessment. This article provides a systematic review of existing
   scholarship on WFD implementation. We identify well-documented areas of
   research, describe largely unchartered territories, and suggest avenues
   for future studies. Methodologically, we relied on a meta-analysis.
   Based on a codebook of more than 35 items, we analyzed 89 journal
   articles reporting on the implementation of the directive in EU member
   states. Our review is organized around three major themes. The first is
   ``who, when, and where{''}; we explore publication patterns, thereby
   looking into authors, timelines, and target journals. The second is
   ``what{''}; we analyze the object of study in our source articles with a
   particular focus on case study countries, policy levels, the temporal
   stage of WFD implementation, and if the directive was not studied in its
   entirety, the aspect of the WFD that received scholarly attention. The
   third is ``how,{''} i.e., theoretical and methodological choices made
   when studying the WFD.}},

Abstract = {{Biological diversity is, to a large extent, a matter of variation in
   size. Proportional (isometric) scaling, where large and small
   individuals are magnified versions of each other, is often assumed to be
   the most common way morphological traits scale relative to overall size
   within species. However, the many traits showing nonproportional
   (allometric) scaling have motivated some of the most discussed
   hypotheses on scaling relationships in biology, like the positive
   allometry hypothesis for secondary sexual traits and the negative
   allometry hypothesis for genitals. I evaluate more than 3,200 allometric
   parameters from the literature and find that negative allometry, not
   isometry, is the expected scaling relationship of morphological traits
   within species. Slopes of secondary sexual traits are more often steeper
   compared with other traits, but slopes larger than unity are also common
   for traits not under sexual selection. The steepness of the allometric
   slope is accordingly a weak predictor of past and present patterns of
   selection. Scaling of genitals varies across taxonomic groups, but
   negative allometry of genitals in insects and spiders is a consistent
   pattern. Finally, I find indications that terrestrial organisms may have
   a different scaling of morphological traits overall compared with
   aquatic species.}},

Abstract = {{The nitrogen (N) cycle has the potential to regulate climate change
   through its influence on carbon (C) sequestration. Although extensive
   research has explored whether or not progressive N limitation (PNL)
   occurs under CO2 enrichment, a comprehensive assessment of the processes
   that regulate PNL is still lacking. Here, we quantitatively synthesized
   the responses of all major processes and pools in the terrestrial N
   cycle with meta-analysis of CO2 experimental data available in the
   literature. The results showed that CO2 enrichment significantly
   increased N sequestration in the plant and litter pools but not in the
   soil pool, partially supporting one of the basic assumptions in the PNL
   hypothesis that elevated CO2 results in more N sequestered in organic
   pools. However, CO2 enrichment significantly increased the N influx via
   biological N fixation and the loss via N2O emission, but decreased the N
   efflux via leaching. In addition, no general diminished CO2
   fertilization effect on plant growth was observed over time up to the
   longest experiment of 13 years. Overall, our analyses suggest that the
   extra N supply by the increased biological N fixation and decreased
   leaching may potentially alleviate PNL under elevated CO2 conditions in
   spite of the increases in plant N sequestration and N2O emission.
   Moreover, our syntheses indicate that CO2 enrichment increases soil
   ammonium (NH4) to nitrate (NO) ratio. The changed NH4/NO ratio and
   subsequent biological processes may result in changes in soil
   microenvironments, above-belowground community structures and associated
   interactions, which could potentially affect the terrestrial
   biogeochemical cycles. In addition, our data synthesis suggests that
   more long-term studies, especially in regions other than temperate ones,
   are needed for comprehensive assessments of the PNL hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{The accelerating rate of global change has focused attention on the
   cumulative impacts of novel and extreme environmental changes (i.e.
   stressors), especially in marine ecosystems. As integrators of local
   catchment and regional processes, freshwater ecosystems are also ranked
   highly sensitive to the net effects of multiple stressors, yet there has
   not been a large-scale quantitative synthesis. We analysed data from 88
   papers including 286 responses of freshwater ecosystems to paired
   stressors and discovered that overall, their cumulative mean effect size
   was less than the sum of their single effects (i.e. an antagonistic
   interaction). Net effects of dual stressors on diversity and functional
   performance response metrics were additive and antagonistic,
   respectively. Across individual studies, a simple vote-counting method
   revealed that the net effects of stressor pairs were frequently more
   antagonistic (41\%) than synergistic (28\%), additive (16\%) or reversed
   (15\%). Here, we define a reversal as occurring when the net impact of
   two stressors is in the opposite direction (negative or positive) from
   that of the sum of their single effects. While warming paired with
   nutrification resulted in additive net effects, the overall mean net
   effect of warming combined with a second stressor was antagonistic. Most
   importantly, the mean net effects across all stressor pairs and response
   metrics were consistently antagonistic or additive, contrasting the
   greater prevalence of reported synergies in marine systems. Here, a
   possible explanation for more antagonistic responses by freshwater biota
   to stressors is that the inherent greater environmental variability of
   smaller aquatic ecosystems fosters greater potential for acclimation and
   co-adaptation to multiple stressors.}},

Pages = {{215-223}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification can involve the simplification of
   agroecosystems to crop monocultures while the practices of crop
   rotation, intercropping and companion planting maintain some crop
   diversity over time and space. It is generally postulated that reduced
   diversity can have an impact on ecosystem function. Here we determine
   whether decreased aboveground crop diversity affects belowground
   microbial biodiversity by conducting a meta-analysis of studies
   comparing monocultures and crop rotations. We based taxonomic richness
   and diversity indices on both molecular and biochemical fingerprinting
   methods. Soils under a higher diversity of crops in rotation produced
   higher microbial richness (+15.11\%, n = 26) and diversity (+3.36\%, n =
   43) scores. This effect was significantly influenced by the proxy and
   methodology used where pyrosequencing produced higher richness scores
   compared to fingerprinting methods. Longer study trials produced larger
   increases in microbial richness, although the opposite was true for
   microbial diversity. The addition of legumes to rotation had no
   consistent effects on microbial diversity or richness. Whether the
   overall rotation-effect on microbial diversity promotes ecosystem
   functioning in terms of nutrient cycling and resilience to stress
   remains unclear. Future studies that incorporate next-generation
   sequencing techniques will help to elucidate complex microbial community
   structures and specific functional niches in agroecosystems. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Both active and passive forest restoration schemes are used in degraded
   landscapes across the world to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem
   service provision. Restoration is increasingly also being implemented in
   biodiversity offset schemes as compensation for loss of natural habitat
   to anthropogenic development. This has raised concerns about the value
   of replacing old-growth forest with plantations, motivating research on
   biodiversity recovery as forest stands age. Functional diversity is now
   advocated as a keymetric for restoration success, yet it has received
   little analytical attention to date. We conducted a meta-analysis of 90
   studies that measured differences in species richness for functional
   groups of fungi, lichens, and beetles between old-growth control and
   planted or secondary treatment forests in temperate, boreal, and
   Mediterranean regions. We identified functional-group-specific
   relationships in the response of species richness to stand age after
   forest disturbance. Ectomycorrhizal fungi averaged 90 years for recovery
   to old-growth values (between 45 years and unrecoverable at 95\%
   prediction limits), and epiphytic lichens took 180 years to reach 90\%
   of old-growth values (between 140 years and never for recovery to
   old-growth values at 95\% prediction limits). Non-saproxylic beetle
   richness, in contrast, decreased as stand age of broadleaved forests
   increased. The slow recovery by some functional groups essential to
   ecosystem functioning makes old-growth forest an effectively
   irreplaceable biodiversity resource that should be exempt from
   biodiversity offsetting initiatives.}},

Title = {{A global meta-analysis of the relative extent of intraspecific trait

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that accounting for intraspecific trait
   variation (ITV) may better address major questions in community ecology.
   However, a general picture of the relative extent of ITV compared to
   interspecific trait variation in plant communities is still missing.
   Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relative extent of ITV within
   and among plant communities worldwide, using a data set encompassing 629
   communities (plots) and 36 functional traits. Overall, ITV accounted for
   25\% of the total trait variation within communities and 32\% of the
   total trait variation among communities on average. The relative extent
   of ITV tended to be greater for whole-plant (e.g. plant height) vs.
   organ-level traits and for leaf chemical (e.g. leaf N and P
   concentration) vs. leaf morphological (e.g. leaf area and thickness)
   traits. The relative amount of ITV decreased with increasing species
   richness and spatial extent, but did not vary with plant growth form or
   climate. These results highlight global patterns in the relative
   importance of ITV in plant communities, providing practical guidelines
   for when researchers should include ITV in trait-based community and
   ecosystem studies.}},

Abstract = {{The temperature dependence of the reaction kinetics of the Rubisco
   enzyme implies that, at the level of a chloroplast, the response of
   photosynthesis to rising atmospheric CO2 concentration (C-a) will
   increase with increasing air temperature. Vegetation models
   incorporating this interaction predict that the response of net primary
   productivity (NPP) to elevated CO2 (eC(a)) will increase with rising
   temperature and will be substantially larger in warm tropical forests
   than in cold boreal forests. We tested these model predictions against
   evidence from eC(a) experiments by carrying out two meta-analyses.
   Firstly, we tested for an interaction effect on growth responses in
   factorial eC(a) x temperature experiments. This analysis showed a
   positive, but nonsignificant interaction effect (95\% CI for
   above-ground biomass response = -0.8, 18.0\%) between eC(a) and
   temperature. Secondly, we tested field-based eC(a) experiments on woody
   plants across the globe for a relationship between the eC(a) effect on
   plant biomass and mean annual temperature (MAT). This second analysis
   showed a positive but nonsignificant correlation between the eC(a)
   response and MAT. The magnitude of the interactions between CO2 and
   temperature found in both meta-analyses were consistent with model
   predictions, even though both analyses gave nonsignificant results.
   Thus, we conclude that it is not possible to distinguish between the
   competing hypotheses of no interaction vs. an interaction based on
   Rubisco kinetics from the available experimental database. Experiments
   in a wider range of temperature zones are required. Until such
   experimental data are available, model predictions should aim to
   incorporate uncertainty about this interaction.}},

   uniformity (i.e. convergence) in the responses of traits to the

   responded uniformly across taxonomic groups, indicating trait
   convergence. For pollution, the low number of studies hampered a
   comparison across taxonomic groups. However, aquatic invertebrates that
   are tolerant, or exhibit high dispersal or reproduction capacities
   increased in response to pollution, whereas body mass and size increased

Abstract = {{Divergent hypotheses have been proposed that suggest plant invasions
   either enhance or degrade the mutualism between plants and arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, but their relative support remains unknown. We
   conducted a meta-analysis using 67 publications, involving 70 native and
   55 invasive plant species to assess support for the enhanced mutualism
   hypothesis, the degraded mutualism hypothesis and an alternative
   hypothesis that factors other than invasive status (such as plant
   functional group) better predict AM function following invasion. We used
   multiple measurements to test these hypotheses: AM fungal colonization,
   growth responses to AM fungi and AM fungal-mediated shifts in
   competitive interactions among native and invasive plants. Additionally,
   we assessed whether invasive plants alter AM associations in native
   plants and whether native and invasive plants host different AM fungal
   abundances and communities. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonization
   (\%) and average growth responses did not differ between native and
   invasive plants. However, growth responses () were dampened among
   invasive plants, and the positive correlation between AM fungal
   colonization and growth response in native plants was absent in invasive
   plants. Rather than plant invasive status, plant functional group was a
   significant explanatory factor; forbs were generally more colonized and
   exhibited positive growth responses (when grown alone and in
   competition), whereas grass responses were neutral to negative.
   Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal abundance (measured by percentage
   colonization, extraradical hyphal and spore densities, as well as
   neutral lipid fatty acid and glomalin concentrations) did not differ
   between native and invasive plants, but invasive plants hosted different
   AM fungal communities in 78\% of studies. AM fungal colonization of
   native plants was lower when grown with, or after, invasive plants,
   likely due to the prevalence of non-mycorrhizal plants in studies of
   neighbour and legacy effects.Synthesis. Neither the degraded nor the
   enhanced mutualism hypothesis was supported, suggesting that invasions
   do not select for directional shifts in AM associations. Instead, our
   results indicate that AM fungi are most likely to influence invasion
   trajectories when native and invasive plants belong to different
   functional groups.}},

Abstract = {{Agroforestry practices may influence pest incidence and abundance both

   whether effects of agroforestry were dependent on crop type (annual or
   perennial), type of pest association (above or belowground) and weed
   type (parasitic Striga weeds or non-parasitic weeds).
   Agroforestry practices resulted in lower abundances of both parasitic
   and non-parasitic weeds, and in higher abundances of natural enemies.
   The effects of agroforestry on invertebrate pests and diseases were
   dependent on crop type. In perennial crops (e.g. coffee, cocoa and
   plantain), agroforestry was associated with lower pest abundances and
   less plant damage. However, the effects were not significant in annual

Abstract = {{Many organisms experience fasting in their life time, and this

   previous studies on the effects of fasting and starvation on stable

   determine how stable isotopes of N-15 and C-13 change with fasting, and
   we tested whether moderators such as taxa and tissue explain residual
   variation. We collected literature data from a wide variety of taxa and
   tissues. We surveyed over 2000 papers, and of these, 26 met our
   selection criteria, resulting in 51 data points for N-15, and 43 data
   points for C-13. We determine that fasting causes an average increase in
   the isotopic value of organisms of 0.5 parts per thousand for N-15 and
   that the only significant moderator is tissue type. We find that the
   overall effect size for C-13 is not significant, but when the
   significant moderator of tissue is considered, significant increases in
   blood and whole organisms are seen with fasting. Our results show that
   across tissues and taxa, the nutritional status of an organism must be

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic habitat disturbance is a strong biodiversity change driver

   dispersal is a key interaction involved in the recruitment of many tree
   species and in consequence critical for biodiversity maintenance,
   studies assessing the effect of different anthropogenic disturbance

   degradation processes affect species diversity (abundance and species
   richness) and interaction rates (i.e., fruit removal and visitation
   rates) of different groups of seed-disperser species at a global scale.
   We obtained 163 case studies from 37 articles. Results indicate that
   habitat degradation had a negative effect on seed-disperser animal
   diversity, whereas habitat fragmentation had a negative effect on
   interaction rates. Birds and insects were more sensitive in terms of
   their diversity, whereas mammals showed a negative effect on interaction
   rates. Regarding habitat, both fragmentation and degradation had a
   negative effect on seed-disperser animal diversity only in temperate
   habitats, and negative effects on interaction rates in tropical and
   temperate habitats. Our results indicate that the impact of human
   disturbance on seed-disperser species and interactions is not

Abstract = {{The response of soil carbon dynamics to climate and land-use change will
   affect both the future climate and the quality of ecosystems. Deep soil
   carbon (> 20 cm) is the primary component of the soil carbon pool, but
   the dynamics of deep soil carbon remain poorly understood. Therefore,
   radiocarbon activity (Delta C-14), which is a function of the age of
   carbon, may help to understand the rates of soil carbon biodegradation
   and stabilization. We analyzed the published C-14 contents in 122
   profiles of mineral soil that were well distributed in most of the large
   world biomes, except for the boreal zone. With a multivariate extension
   of a linear mixed-effects model whose inference was based on the
   parallel combination of two algorithms, the expectation-maximization
   (EM) and the Metropolis-Hasting algorithms, we expressed soil Delta C-14
   profiles as a four-parameter function of depth. The four-parameter model
   produced insightful predictions of soil Delta C-14 as dependent on
   depth, soil type, climate, vegetation, land-use and date of sampling
   (R-2 = 0: 68). Further analysis with the model showed that the age of
   topsoil carbon was primarily affected by climate and cultivation. By
   contrast, the age of deep soil carbon was affected more by soil taxa
   than by climate and thus illustrated the strong dependence of soil
   carbon dynamics on other pedologic traits such as clay content and

Abstract = {{American black duck (Anas rubripes) populations declined by more than
   50\% between the 1950s and 1990s, and the species serves as a flagship
   for conserving salt marsh habitats along the Atlantic Coast. Black ducks
   have generally been well studied throughout the annual cycle, but
   surprisingly, we lack a synthetic, quantitative understanding of their
   space use during the winter. This limits our ability to prioritize
   habitat acquisition and restoration efforts. We used >17,000 telemetry
   locations from 235 black ducks ranging from Connecticut to Virginia to
   study home range composition and space use during winter in relation to
   habitat quality, urbanization, and severe weather. Despite substantial
   environmental variation, home range sizes were similar among regions and
   years. Smaller home and core ranges contained a greater proportion of
   salt marsh habitat, and ducks experiencing more 4-day freeze events had
   larger home and core ranges. Ducks exposed to prolonged periods of cold
   weather had smaller core ranges when those areas comprised more
   energy-rich freshwater habitats. When we examined individual telemetry
   locations, we found that ducks used irregularly inundated high marsh
   more at night, presumably for foraging, and urban habitats more during
   the day and evening crepuscular periods. We found that black ducks used
   regularly inundated low marsh less on days where the temperature never
   rose above freezing, and instead used subtidal areas and forested
   wetlands more. Finally, we found ducks were marginally more likely to
   use freshwater habitats during high tides. Our study confirms that black
   ducks depend on salt marsh for wintering habitat, and points to an
   unexpectedly important role for forested wetlands during periods of cold
   weather. We found no evidence that black ducks avoided urban areas or
   roads, which supports the inclusion of all available habitats in
   carrying capacity modeling. We emphasize that new hypothesis-driven,
   local telemetry studies are needed to further elucidate the
   relationships between black duck movements and environmental variation,
   especially cold weather. Further, given that most remaining coastal
   wetlands are currently protected via state and federal lands, we suggest
   black duck habitat management should strive to acquire and restore
   brackish and forested wetlands in close proximity to coastal marshes.

Abstract = {{Predator diversity and abundance are under strong human pressure in all
   types of ecosystems. Whereas predator potentially control standing
   biomass and species interactions in food webs, their effects on prey
   biomass and especially prey biodiversity have not yet been
   systematically quantified. Here, we test the effects of predation in a
   cross-system meta-analysis of prey diversity and biomass responses to
   local manipulation of predator presence. We found 291 predator removal
   experiments from 87 studies assessing both diversity and biomass
   responses. Across ecosystem types, predator presence significantly
   decreased both biomass and diversity of prey across ecosystems.
   Predation effects were highly similar between ecosystem types, whereas
   previous studies had shown that herbivory or decomposition effects
   differed fundamentally between terrestrial and aquatic systems based on
   different stoichiometry of plant material. Such stoichiometric
   differences between systems are unlikely for carnivorous predators,
   where effect sizes on species richness strongly correlated to effect
   sizes on biomass. However, the negative predation effect on prey biomass
   was ameliorated significantly with increasing prey richness and
   increasing species richness of the manipulated predator assemblage.
   Moreover, with increasing richness of the predator assemblage present,
   the overall negative effects of predation on prey richness switched to
   positive effects. Our meta-analysis revealed strong general
   relationships between predator diversity, prey diversity and the
   interaction strength between trophic levels in terms of biomass. This
   study indicates that anthropogenic changes in predator abundance and
   diversity will potentially have strong effects on trophic interactions

Abstract = {{Assortative mating by size has been argued to be widespread in the
   animal kingdom. However, the strength of size-assortative mating is
   known to vary considerably between species and the underlying mechanisms
   promoting this inter-specific variation remain largely unexplored.
   Size-assortative mating has been proposed to be particularly strong in
   simultaneous hermaphrodites, i.e. organisms that produce male and female
   gametes at the same time. Here, we build on this hypothesis by arguing
   that size-assortative mating mediated by sexual selection is generally
   stronger in reciprocally mating hermaphrodites compared with
   unilaterally mating species and separate-sexed organisms. We report a
   series of empirical tests suggesting that size-assortative mating in the
   unilaterally copulating freshwater snail Physa acuta is caused by
   spatial clustering of similar-sized individuals and not by mate choice.
   In addition, we present a meta-analysis testing, for the first time, the
   hypothesis that sexual selection-mediated size-assortative mating is
   stronger in reciprocally copulating simultaneous hermaphrodites.
   Overall, we found significant size-assortative mating across 18 tested
   species and substantial inter-specific variation. Importantly, part of
   this variation can be explained by mating type, providing support for
   the hypothesis that size-assortative mating is stronger in reciprocally
   mating hermaphrodites compared with unilaterally mating species. We
   highlight potential pitfalls when testing for sexual selection-mediated
   size-assortative mating and discuss the need for more experimental and
   comparative approaches in order to resolve the observed variation in the
   strength of size-assortative mating among species.}},

   exploiting meta-regression-analysis techniques to test the effectiveness

Abstract = {{There have been few attempts to synthesise the growing body of
   literature on phenotypic plasticity to reveal patterns and generalities
   about the extent and magnitude of plastic responses. Here, we conduct a
   review and meta-analysis of published literature on phenotypic
   plasticity in aquatic (marine and freshwater) gastropods, a common
   system for studying plasticity. We identified 96 studies, using
   pre-determined search terms, published between 1985 and November 2013.
   The literature was dominated by studies of predator-induced shell form,
   snail growth rates and life history parameters of a few model taxa,
   accounting for 67\% of all studies reviewed. Meta-analyses indicated
   average plastic responses in shell thickness, shell shape, and growth
   and fecundity of freshwater species was at least three times larger than
   in marine species. Within marine gastropods, species with planktonic
   development had similar average plastic responses to species with
   benthic development. We discuss these findings in the context of the
   role of costs and limits of phenotypic plasticity and environmental
   heterogeneity as important constraints on the evolution of plasticity.
   We also consider potential publication biases and discuss areas for

Abstract = {{Chemical communication is the oldest form of communication, spreading
   across all forms of life. In insects, cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC)
   function as chemical cues for the recognition of mates, species, and
   nest-mates in social insects. Although much is known about the function
   of individual hydrocarbons and their biosynthesis, a phylogenetic
   overview is lacking. Here, we review the CHC profiles of 241 species of
   Hymenoptera, one of the largest and most important insect orders, which
   includes the Symphyta (sawflies), the polyphyletic Parasitica
   (parasitoid wasps), and the Aculeata (wasps, bees, and ants). We
   investigated whether these taxonomic groups differed in the presence and
   absence of CHC classes and whether the sociality of a species
   (solitarily vs. social) had an effect on CHC profile complexity. We
   found that the main CHC classes (i.e., n-alkanes, alkenes, and
   methylalkanes) were all present early in the evolutionary history of the
   Hymenoptera, as evidenced by their presence in ancient Symphyta and
   primitive Parasitica wasps. Throughout all groups within the
   Hymenoptera, the more complex a CHC the fewer species that produce it,
   which may reflect the Occam's razor principle that insects' only
   biosynthesize the most simple compound that fulfil its needs.
   Surprisingly, there was no difference in the complexity of CHC profiles
   between social and solitary species, with some of the most complex CHC
   profiles belonging to the Parasitica. This profile complexity has been
   maintained in the ants, but some specialization in biosynthetic pathways
   has led to a simplification of profiles in the aculeate wasps and bees.
   The absence of CHC classes in some taxa or species may be due to gene
   silencing or down-regulation rather than gene loss, as demonstrated by
   sister species having highly divergent CHC profiles, and cannot be
   predicted by their phylogenetic history. The presence of highly complex
   CHC profiles prior to the vast radiation of the social Hymenoptera
   indicates a `spring-loaded' system where the diversity of CHC needed for
   the complex communication systems of social insects were already present
   for natural selection to act upon, rather than having evolved
   independently. This diversity may have aided the multiple independent
   evolution of sociality within the Aculeata.}},

Abstract = {{Despite much attention, history of sheep (Ovis aries) evolution,
   including its dating, demographic trajectory and geographic spread,
   remains controversial. To address these questions, we generated 45
   complete and 875 partial mitogenomic sequences, and performed a
   meta-analysis of these and published ovine mitochondrial DNA sequences
   (n = 3,229) across Eurasia. We inferred that O. orientalis and O.
   musimon share the most recent female ancestor with O. aries at
   approximately 0.790 Ma (95\% CI: 0.637-0.934 Ma) during the Middle
   Pleistocene, substantially predating the domestication event (similar to
   8-11 ka). By reconstructing historical variations in effective
   population size, we found evidence of a rapid population increase
   approximately 20-60 ka, immediately before the Last Glacial Maximum.
   Analyses of lineage expansions showed two sheep migratory waves at
   approximately 4.5-6.8 ka (lineages A and B: similar to 6.4-6.8 ka; C:
   similar to 4.5 ka) across eastern Eurasia, which could have been
   influenced by prehistoric West-East commercial trade and deliberate
   mating of domestic and wild sheep, respectively. A continent-scale
   examination of lineage diversity and approximate Bayesian computation
   analyses indicated that the Mongolian Plateau region was a secondary
   center of dispersal, acting as a ``transportation hub{''} in eastern
   Eurasia: Sheep from the Middle Eastern domestication center were
   inferred to have migrated through the Caucasus and Central Asia, and
   arrived in North and Southwest China (lineages A, B, and C) and the
   Indian subcontinent (lineages B and C) through this region. Our results
   provide new insights into sheep domestication, particularly with respect
   to origins and migrations to and from eastern Eurasia.}},

Abstract = {{Inoculation may influence mycorrhizal colonization and provide benefits
   to plants in restoration projects. However, it is unclear whether
   inoculation has consistent effects across ecosystem types, if it has
   long-term effects on colonization, and whether sources of inocula differ
   in their effectiveness. To address these issues, we performed a
   meta-analysis of published restoration studies across a variety of
   ecosystems to examine the effects of mycorrhizal inoculation on
   mycorrhizal establishment and plant growth under field conditions.
   Although we included trials from a variety of geographic locations,
   disturbance types, and ecosystem types, the majority were based in
   temperate ecosystems in the Northern Hemisphere, and fewer trials were
   from tropical ecosystems. Across ecosystem types, we found that
   inoculation consistently increased the abundance of mycorrhizal fungi in
   degraded ecosystems, and thus improved the establishment of plants.
   These benefits did not significantly attenuate over time. Moreover,
   inocula from different sources varied in their effects on mycorrhizal
   colonization. Inocula sourced from reference ecosystems and inocula with
   specific fungal species yielded higher increases in mycorrhizal
   colonization than did inocula from commercial sources. These results
   suggest that inocula source matters, and that an initial investment into
   mycorrhizal inoculation could provide lasting benefits for facilitating
   the establishment of the below-and aboveground components of restored
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing need for reliable biomarkers of the physiological
   stress response in basic ecological investigations and
   conservation-specific applications. One effect of stress hormone
   secretion is the alteration of circulating leucocytes, specifically an
   increase in the heterophil:lymphocyte ratio (HLR). There have been
   numerous studies and reviews of the relationship between the stress
   response and HLR, yet the data have not been systematically analysed
   across studies. Here, we performed meta-analyses of studies in which
   paired values of plasma corticosterone (CORT) and HLR were available to
   investigate the relationship between these parameters. Specifically, we
   analysed CORT and HLR as baseline measures between treatment (or
   stressed' populations) and control (or reference' populations).
   Additionally, we investigated the relationship within CORT and HLR to
   identify temporal patterns of the response as a result of the duration
   of the stressor. Across studies, we identified that CORT and HLR are
   significantly elevated in populations subjected to environmentally
   stressful conditions. While not significantly different, CORT tended to
   be more elevated than HLR in the stressed populations. We found that
   there is a significant, negative relationship between CORT and the
   temporal duration of environmental stress. Additionally, we found a
   significant break point in this response at 85days of stress duration,
   above which there is not a clear relationship between CORT and duration.
   This indicates that the CORT response to environmental stress
   attenuates. We found a small but positive significant relationship
   between HLR and temporal duration of environmental stress. This suggests
   that the elevation of HLR in response to environmental stress does not
   decrease over time. Our data identified that data gaps of wild
   populations of species exist and that more studies pairing physiological
   stress responses will further our understanding of how populations
   respond to environmental challenges. We found that CORT and HLR
   responded differently to stress, depending on captivity status, whether
   the study population was the domestic chicken, and the sex of the study
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions are acknowledged among the main drivers of global
   changes in biodiversity. Despite compelling evidence of species
   interactions being strongly regulated by environmental conditions, there
   is a dearth of studies investigating how the effects of non-native
   species vary among areas exposed to different anthropogenic pressures.
   Focusing on marine macroalgae, we performed a meta-analysis to test
   whether and how the direction and magnitude of their effects on resident
   communities and species varies in relation to cumulative anthropogenic
   impact levels. The relationship between human impact levels and
   non-native species impact intensity emerged only for a reduced subset of
   the response variables examined. Yet, there was a trend for the effects
   of non-native species on community biomass and abundance and on species
   abundance to become less negative at heavily impacted sites. By
   contrast, the magnitude of negative effects of seaweed on community
   evenness tended to increase with human impact levels. The hypothesis of
   decreasing severity of invader' impacts along a gradient of habitat
   degradation was also tested experimentally at a regional scale by
   comparing the effects of the removal of non-native alga, Caulerpa
   cylindracea, on resident assemblages among rocky reefs exposed to
   different anthropogenic pressures. Assemblages at urban and pristine
   site did not differ when invaded, but did so when C. cylindracea was
   removed. Our results suggest that, despite the generally weak
   relationship between human impacts levels and non-native species
   impacts, more negative impacts can be expected in less stressful
   environments (i.e. less degraded or pristine sites), where competitive
   interactions are presumably the driving force structuring resident
   communities. Implementing strategies for controlling the establishment
   of non-native seaweeds should be, thus, considered a priority for
   preserving biodiversity in relatively pristine areas. On the other hand,
   control of invaders at degraded sites could be warranted to lessen their
   role as propagule sources.}},

Abstract = {{Plant communities are often dispersal-limited and zoochory can be an
   efficient mechanism for plants to colonize new patches of potentially
   suitable habitat. We predicted that seed dispersal by ungulates acts as
   an ecological filter - which differentially affects individuals
   according to their characteristics and shapes species assemblages - and
   that the filter varies according to the dispersal mechanism
   (endozoochory, fur-epizoochory and hoof-epizoochory). We conducted
   two-step individual participant data meta-analyses of 52 studies on
   plant dispersal by ungulates in fragmented landscapes, comparing eight
   plant traits and two habitat indicators between dispersed and
   non-dispersed plants. We found that ungulates dispersed at least 44\% of
   the available plant species. Moreover, some plant traits and habitat
   indicators increased the likelihood for plant of being dispersed.
   Persistent or nitrophilous plant species from open habitats or bearing
   dry or elongated diaspores were more likely to be dispersed by
   ungulates, whatever the dispersal mechanism. In addition, endozoochory
   was more likely for diaspores bearing elongated appendages whereas
   epizoochory was more likely for diaspores released relatively high in
   vegetation. Hoof-epizoochory was more likely for light diaspores without
   hooked appendages. Fur-epizoochory was more likely for diaspores with
   appendages, particularly elongated or hooked ones. We thus observed a
   gradient of filtering effect among the three dispersal mechanisms.
   Endozoochory had an effect of rather weak intensity (impacting six plant
   characteristics with variations between ungulate-dispersed and
   non-dispersed plant species mostly below 25\%), whereas hoof-epizoochory
   had a stronger effect (eight characteristics included five ones with
   above 75\% variation), and fur-epizoochory an even stronger one (nine
   characteristics included six ones with above 75\% variation). Our
   results demonstrate that seed dispersal by ungulates is an ecological
   filter whose intensity varies according to the dispersal mechanism
   considered. Ungulates can thus play a key role in plant community
   dynamics and have implications for plant spatial distribution patterns
   at multiple scales.}},

   developed examining effects of individual plants on their local
   environments (individual plant effects). Here, we synthesize this work
   using meta-analysis to show that plant effects are strong and pervasive
   across ecosystems on six continents. Overall, soil properties beneath
   individual plants differ from those of neighbours by an average of 41\%.
   Although the magnitudes of individual plant effects exhibit weak
   relationships with climate and latitude, they are significantly stronger
   in deserts and tundra than forests, and weaker in intensively managed

Abstract = {{Meta-analysis, the statistical synthesis of pertinent literature to
   develop evidence-based conclusions, is relatively new to the field of
   molecular ecology, with the first meta-analysis published in the journal
   Molecular Ecology in 2003 (Slate \& Phua 2003). The goal of this article
   is to formalize the definition of meta-analysis for the authors,
   editors, reviewers and readers of Molecular Ecology by completing a
   review of the meta-analyses previously published in this journal. We
   also provide a brief overview of the many components required for
   meta-analysis with a more specific discussion of the issues related to
   the field of molecular ecology, including the use and statistical
   considerations of Wright's F-ST and its related analogues as effect
   sizes in meta-analysis. We performed a literature review to identify
   articles published as `meta-analyses' in Molecular Ecology, which were
   then evaluated by at least two reviewers. We specifically targeted
   Molecular Ecology publications because as a flagship journal in this
   field, meta-analyses published in Molecular Ecology have the potential
   to set the standard for meta-analyses in other journals. We found that
   while many of these reviewed articles were strong meta-analyses, others
   failed to follow standard meta-analytical techniques. One of these
   unsatisfactory meta-analyses was in fact a secondary analysis. Other
   studies attempted meta-analyses but lacked the fundamental statistics
   that are considered necessary for an effective and powerful
   meta-analysis. By drawing attention to the inconsistency of studies
   labelled as meta-analyses, we emphasize the importance of understanding
   the components of traditional meta-analyses to fully embrace the
   strengths of quantitative data synthesis in the field of molecular
   ecology.}},

   guidelines and diagnostics for assessing when the response ratio is

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{A future higher risk of severe flooding of streams and rivers has been
   projected to change riparian plant community composition and species
   richness, but the extent and direction of the expected change remain
   uncertain. We conducted a meta-analysis to synthesize globally available
   experimental evidence and assess the effects of increased flooding on
   (1) riparian adult plant and seedling survival, (2) riparian plant
   biomass and (3) riparian plant species composition and richness. We
   evaluated which plant traits are of key importance for the response of
   riparian plant species to flooding. We identified and analysed 53 papers
   from ISI Web of Knowledge which presented quantitative experimental
   results on flooding treatments and corresponding control situations. Our
   meta-analysis demonstrated how longer duration of flooding, greater
   depth of flooding and, particularly, their combination reduce seedling
   survival of most riparian species. Plant height above water level,
   ability to elongate shoots and plasticity in root porosity were decisive
   for adult plant survival and growth during longer periods of flooding.
   Both quiescence' and escape' proved to be successful strategies
   promoting riparian plant survival, which was reflected in the wide
   variation in survival (full range between 0 and 100\%) under fully
   submerged conditions, while plants that protrude above the water level
   (>20cm) almost all survive. Our survey confirmed that the projected
   increase in the duration and depth of flooding periods is sufficient to
   result in species shifts. These shifts may lead to increased or
   decreased riparian species richness depending on the nutrient, climatic
   and hydrological status of the catchment. Species richness was generally
   reduced at flooded sites in nutrient-rich catchments and sites that
   previously experienced relatively stable hydrographs (e.g. rain-fed
   lowland streams). Species richness usually increased at sites in desert
   and semi-arid climate regions (e.g. intermittent streams).}},

Abstract = {{A vast body of literature demonstrated that anthropogenic disturbances
   such as overgrazing and fire are key drivers of abrupt transition
   between vegetation types in ecosystems. In this study, we propose that
   the hydrological context (described in terms of rainfall,
   evapotranspiration and water yield) is a first-order, primordial
   determinant of the propensity of ecosystems to undergo transition. This
   implies that the anthropogenic disturbance is a second-order determinant
   that is strongly conditioned by the first one. Through the meta-analysis
   of existing studies, a collection of 685 geo-referenced study cases was
   organized to study the hydrological characteristics of three climatic
   regions and three ecosystems that vary in their relation between woody
   and grassy plants. Thus, humid, sub-humid and dry climatic regions,
   respectively, receiving >1000, 500-1000 and <500mmyear(-1), were
   studied, and possible transition mechanisms among grasslands/savannas,
   shrublands and forests were analysed. The results showed that the
   ecohydrological context determines the probabilities of ecosystems
   transitions in different climatic regions and the prevalence of
   alternative transition mechanisms. We showed that transition of forests
   into other ecosystems is highly improbable in high-precipitation
   regions, more probable and likely subject to a bi-stable and reversible
   regime in sub-humid regions, and highly probable and irreversible in dry
   regions. Factors such as runoff, deep-water drainage, fire,
   flammable/nonflammable biomass and overgrazing were considered as
   hypothetical transition mechanisms. As a novel finding, we demonstrate
   that ecohydrology, as a determinant of transition, is a factor that
   operates at a hierarchical level higher than that of the human-driven
   disturbance. A synthetic graphical model was proposed to characterize
   resilience (the capacity of ecosystems to withstand transition) in the
   three study climatic regions. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Using a meta-analytical approach, we found a positive relationship

   investigated avian monogamous species. However, factors triggering
   female mating decisions and potential fitness benefits from extrapair
   matings still remain poorly understood. Some studies suggest that
   females mate socially with low-quality males but seek extrapair mates
   offering superior genes for their progeny. This mating strategy may also
   help in mitigating the potential negative effects of pairing with a

Abstract = {{Estimating trophic structures is a common approach used to retrieve
   information regarding energy pathways, predation, and competition in
   complex ecosystems. The application of amino acid (AA) compound-specific
   nitrogen (N) isotope analysis (CSIA) is a relatively new method used to
   estimate trophic position (TP) and feeding relationships in diverse
   organisms. Here, we conducted the first meta-analysis of delta N-15 AA
   values from measurements of 359 marine species covering four trophic
   levels, and compared TP estimates from AA-CSIA to literature values
   derived from food items, gut or stomach content analysis. We tested
   whether the AA trophic enrichment factor (TEF), or the N-15 enrichment
   among different individual AAs is constant across trophic levels and
   whether inclusion of delta N-15 values from multiple AAs improves TP
   estimation. For the TEF of glutamic acid relative to phenylalanine (Phe)
   we found an average value of 6.6 aEuro degrees across all taxa, which is
   significantly lower than the commonly applied 7.6 aEuro degrees. We
   found that organism feeding ecology influences TEF values of several
   trophic AAs relative to Phe, with significantly higher TEF values for
   herbivores compared to omnivores and carnivores, while TEF values were
   also significantly lower for animals excreting urea compared to
   ammonium. Based on the comparison of multiple model structures using the
   metadata of delta N-15 AA values we show that increasing the number of
   AAs in principle improves precision in TP estimation. This meta-analysis
   clarifies the advantages and limitations of using individual delta N-15
   AA values as tools in trophic ecology and provides a guideline for the
   future application of AA-CSIA to food web studies.}},

Abstract = {{Quantification of changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and SOC stock as
   influenced by fertilization practices is needed for the improvement of
   carbon (C) sequestration and soil quality. A meta-analysis of 582
   paired-treatment data from 95 long-term field experiments published from
   1980 to 2012 was used to characterize the changes in SOC under different
   fertilization treatments and residue management practices in China's
   paddy soils. All treatments sequestrated significant amounts of C
   compared with the control (CK, no fertilizer application). The greatest
   mean difference in SOC change rates was measured in the NPKM (mineral
   nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium plus manure) treatment, i.e., 0.401 g
   kg(-1) yr(-1), followed by the M (manure only) treatment (0.36 g kg(-1)
   yr(-1)), while the N (mineral nitrogen only) treatment caused the lowest
   rate of 0.046 g kg(-1) yr(-1). The rates of SOC change in the
   fertilization treatthents with C incorporation (e.g., manure application
   or straw return) were noticeably higher than those treated with
   inorganic chemical fertilizers only. The mean difference in the SOC
   change rates decreased with time and duration of the experiments. The
   effects of the initial SOC content on the rates of SOC change were not
   significant, and the effects of SOC accumulation originating from the
   fertilization treatments depended on the cropping systems. Potential SOC
   sequestration estimates were more accurate when two factors
   (sequestration duration and SOC saturation level) were taken into
   consideration. Our results indicate that the application of manure
   (e.g., M or NPKM) showed the greatest potential for C sequestration in
   agricultural soil and produced the longest SOC sequestration duration
   (45-51 yr). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding varying levels of biodiversity within cities is pivotal to
   protect it in the face of global urbanisation. In the early stages of
   urban ecology studies on intra-urban biodiversity focused on the
   urban-rural gradient, representing a broad generalisation of features of
   the urban landscape. Increasingly, studies classify the urban landscape
   in more detail, quantifying separately the effects of individual urban
   features on biodiversity levels. However, while separate factors
   influencing biodiversity variation among cities worldwide have recently
   been analysed, a global analysis on the factors influencing biodiversity
   levels within cities is still lacking. We here present the first
   meta-analysis on intra-urban biodiversity variation across a large
   variety of taxonomic groups of 75 cities worldwide. Our results show
   that patch area and corridors have the strongest positive effects on
   biodiversity, complemented by vegetation structure. Local, biotic and
   management habitat variables were significantly more important than
   landscape, abiotic or design variables. Large sites greater than 50ha
   are necessary to prevent a rapid loss of area-sensitive species. This
   indicates that, despite positive impacts of biodiversity-friendly
   management, increasing the area of habitat patches and creating a

Abstract = {{Marine organisms are simultaneously exposed to anthropogenic stressors
   with likely interactive effects, including synergisms in which the
   combined effects of multiple stressors are greater than the sum of
   individual effects. Early life stages of marine organisms are
   potentially vulnerable to the stressors associated with global change,
   but identifying general patterns across studies, species and response
   variables is challenging. This review represents the first meta-analysis
   of multistressor studies to target early marine life stages (embryo to
   larvae), particularly between temperature, salinity and pH as these are
   the best studied. Knowledge gaps in research on multiple abiotic
   stressors and early life stages are also identified. The meta-analysis
   yielded several key results: (1) Synergistic interactions (65\% of
   individual tests) are more common than additive (17\%) or antagonistic
   (17\%) interactions. (2) Larvae are generally more vulnerable than
   embryos to thermal and pH stress. (3) Survival is more likely than
   sublethal responses to be affected by thermal, salinity and pH stress.
   (4) Interaction types vary among stressors, ontogenetic stages and
   biological responses, but they are more consistent among phyla. (5)
   Ocean acidification is a greater stressor for calcifying than
   noncalcifying larvae. Despite being more ecologically realistic than
   single-factor studies, multifactorial studies may still oversimplify
   complex systems, and so meta-analyses of the data from them must be
   cautiously interpreted with regard to extrapolation to field conditions.
   Nonetheless, our results identify taxa with early life stages that may
   be particularly vulnerable (e.g. molluscs, echinoderms) or robust (e.g.
   arthropods, cnidarians) to abiotic stress. We provide a list of
   recommendations for future multiple stressor studies, particularly those

Abstract = {{Many species have fragmented distribution with small isolated

   (genetic rescue), these populations are likely to be extirpated.
   However, there have been only similar to 20 published cases of such
   outcrossing for conservation purposes, probably a very low proportion of
   populations that would potentially benefit. As one impediment to genetic
   rescues is the lack of an overview of the magnitude and consistency of
   genetic rescue effects in wild species, I carried out a meta-analysis.
   Outcrossing of inbred populations resulted in beneficial effects in
   92.9\% of 156 cases screened as having a low risk of outbreeding
   depression. The median increase in composite fitness (combined fecundity
   and survival) following outcrossing was 148\% in stressful environments
   and 45\% in benign ones. Fitness benefits also increased significantly
   with maternal F (reduction in inbreeding coefficient due to gene flow)
   and for naturally outbreeding versus inbreeding species. However,
   benefits did not differ significantly among invertebrates, vertebrates
   and plants. Evolutionary potential for fitness characters in inbred

Abstract = {{We present a meta-analysis of experiments in which researchers used
   litter bags or similar enclosures to explore three questions: Do soil
   macrofauna increase the removal of litter from the soil surface? How is
   this mass loss of litter by macrofauna affected by climate and litter
   quality? To what extent does litter loss from litter layer by macrofauna
   correspond with litter mineralization? In total, we found 132 published
   field experiments in which authors compared litter bags with mesh sizes
   that did permit or not permit access by soil fauna. Meta-analysis of
   these experiments indicated that litter removal was significantly
   greater from bags that did permitted rather than did not permitted soil
   macrofauna access. When we divided these studies according to climate, a
   significant positive effect of soil fauna on litter removal was only
   evident from the warm humid, temperate regions with correspond to
   deciduous forest zone. When studies from this climate zone were sorted
   according to litter C:N ratio, the effect of fauna was significant in
   all cases except when the ratio was low (<20), and the effect of fauna
   was greatest when the ratio was intermediate (20-30). To assess how
   litter removal from litter bags corresponds with mineralization, we
   reviewed 11 published experiments that used litter boxes that were or
   were not accessible to soil macrofauna and 8 studies where fauna was
   experimentally removed and added. These boxes contained both litter and
   a mineral soil layer, which allowed researchers to estimate litter

Abstract = {{The growing of catch crops aims to prevent nutrient leaching in autumn
   after harvest and during the following winter, but due to competition,
   catch crops may also reduce yields of the main crop. We used
   meta-analysis to quantitatively review 35 studies conducted in Denmark,
   Sweden, Finland and Norway over the past four decades. These studies
   assessed the effect of both non-legume and legume catch crops undersown
   in spring cereals on nitrogen (N) leaching loss or its risk as estimated
   by the content of soil nitrate N(NO3- - N) or its sum with ammonium
   N(NH4+ - N) in late autumn. The meta-analysis also included the grain
   yield and N content of spring cereals. To identify sources of variation,
   we studied the effects of soil texture and management (ploughing time,
   the amount of N applied), as well as climatic (annual precipitation) and
   experimental conditions (duration of experiments, lysimeter vs. field
   experiments, the decade in which the experiment took place).
   Compared to control groups with no catch crops, non-legume catch crops,
   mainly ryegrass species, reduced N leaching loss by 50\% on average, and
   soil nitrate N or inorganic N by 35\% in autumn. Italian ryegrass
   depleted soil N more effectively (by 60\%) than did perennial ryegrass
   or Westerwolds ryegrass (by 25\%). In contrast, legumes (white and red
   clovers) did not diminish the risk for N leaching. Otherwise, the effect
   on N leaching and its risk were consistent across the studies conducted
   in different countries on clay and coarse-textured mineral soils with
   different ploughing times, N fertilization rates (<160 kg ha(-1)), and
   amounts of annual precipitation (480-1040 mm). Non-legume catch crops
   reduced grain yield by 3\% with no changes in grain N content. In
   contrast, legumes and mixed catch crops increased both grain yield and
   grain N content by 6\%.
   Therefore, in spring cereal production, non-legume catch crops represent
   a universal and effective method for reducing N leaching across the
   varieties of soils and weather conditions in the Nordic countries.
   Moreover, the trade-off between potential grain yield loss and
   environmental benefits seems tolerable and can be taken into account in
   environmental subsidy schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An increasing number of studies have emphasized the need to bridge the
   disciplines of ecology and geomorphology. A large number of case studies
   show that organisms can affect erosion, but a comprehensive
   understanding of biological impacts on sediment transport conditions is
   still lacking. We use meta-analysis to synthesize published data to
   quantify the effects of the abundance, body size, and behavior of
   organisms on erosion in streams. We also explore the influence of
   current velocity, discharge, and sediment grain size on the strength of
   biotic effects on erosion. We found that species that both increase
   erosion (destabilizers) and decrease erosion (stabilizers) can alter
   incipient sediment motion, sediment suspension, and sediment deposition
   above control conditions in which the organisms were not present. When
   abundance was directly manipulated, these biotic effects were
   consistently stronger in the higher abundance treatment, increasing
   effect sizes by 66\%. Per capita effect size and per capita biomass were
   also consistently positively correlated. Fish and crustaceans were the
   most studied organisms, but aquatic insects increased the effect size by
   5503 compared to other types of organisms after accounting for biomass.
   In streams with lower discharge and smaller grain sizes, we consistently
   found stronger biotic effects. Taken collectively, these findings
   provide synthetic evidence that biology can affect physical processes in
   streams, and these effects can be mediated by hydraulic energy. We
   suggest that future studies focus on understudied organisms, such as
   biofilms, conducting experiments under realistic field conditions, and
   developing hypotheses for the effect of biology on erosion and velocity
   currents in the context of restoration to better understand the forces
   that mediate physical disturbances in stream ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanisation and agriculture cause declines for many wildlife, but some
   species benefit from novel resources, especially food, provided in
   human-dominated habitats. Resulting shifts in wildlife ecology can alter
   infectious disease dynamics and create opportunities for cross-species
   transmission, yet predicting host-pathogen responses to resource
   provisioning is challenging. Factors enhancing transmission, such as
   increased aggregation, could be offset by better host immunity due to
   improved nutrition. Here, we conduct a review and meta-analysis to show
   that food provisioning results in highly heterogeneous infection
   outcomes that depend on pathogen type and anthropogenic food source. We
   also find empirical support for behavioural and immune mechanisms
   through which human-provided resources alter host exposure and tolerance
   to pathogens. A review of recent theoretical models of resource
   provisioning and infection dynamics shows that changes in host contact
   rates and immunity produce strong non-linear responses in pathogen
   invasion and prevalence. By integrating results of our meta-analysis
   back into a theoretical framework, we find provisioning amplifies
   pathogen invasion under increased host aggregation and tolerance, but
   reduces transmission if provisioned food decreases dietary exposure to
   parasites. These results carry implications for wildlife disease
   management and highlight areas for future work, such as how resource
   shifts might affect virulence evolution.}},

Abstract = {{The seagrass Posidonia oceanica is a key engineering species structuring
   coastal marine systems throughout much of the Mediterranean basin. Its
   decline is of concern, leading to the search for short- and long-term
   indicators of seagrass health. Using ArcGIS maps from a recent,
   high-resolution (1-4km) modelling study of 18 disturbance factors
   affecting coastal marine systems across the Mediterranean (Micheli etal.
   2013, ), we tested for correlations with genetic diversity metrics
   (allelic diversity, genotypic/clonal diversity and heterozygosity) in a
   meta-analysis of 56 meadows. Contrary to initial predictions, weak but
   significantly positive correlations were found for commercial shipping,
   organic pollution (pesticides) and cumulative impact. This
   counterintuitive finding suggests greater resistance and resilience of
   individuals with higher genetic and genotypic diversity under
   disturbance (at least for a time) and/or increased sexual reproduction
   under an intermediate disturbance model. We interpret the absence of low
   and medium levels of genetic variation at impacted locations as probable
   local extinctions of individuals that already exceeded their resistance
   capacity. Alternatively, high diversity at high-impact sites is likely a
   temporal artefact, reflecting the mismatch with pre-environmental impact
   conditions, especially because flowering and sexual recruitment are
   seldom observed. While genetic diversity metrics are a valuable tool for
   restoration and mitigation, caution must be exercised in the
   interpretation of correlative patterns as found in this study, because
   the exceptional longevity of individuals creates a temporal mismatch
   that may falsely suggest good meadow health status, while gradual
   deterioration of allelic diversity might go unnoticed.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive plant response to control efforts is strongly modified by
   site-specific factors, treatment timing, and environmental conditions
   following treatment, making management outcomes challenging to predict.
   Systematic reviews, which involve quantitative synthesis of data, can
   address this challenge by identifying general patterns of treatment
   effects across studies and quantifying the degree to which these effects
   vary. We conducted a systematic review of medusahead (Taeniatherum
   caput-medusae {[}L.] Nevski) control treatments that couples a
   meta-analysis on control data with an assessment of stakeholder needs to
   identify critical medusahead management knowledge gaps. With the
   meta-analysis we generated effect size estimates of how combinations of
   herbicide, burning, seeding, and grazing impacted medusahead on
   rangeland dominated by either annual or perennial vegetation. All
   combinations of treatments in both rangeland systems provided
   significant short-term control of medusahead, although treatment effects
   were highly transient on perennial rangeland, particularly for seeding
   treatments. Stakeholders listed grazing as a preferred management tool,
   and on annual rangeland an almost twofold reduction in medusahead
   abundance was achieved by timing high stocking rates to match
   phenological stages when medusahead was most susceptible to defoliation.
   Insufficient data were available to evaluate effects of grazing on
   medusahead on perennial rangeland. On the basis of these data and our
   stakeholder survey, four major information needs emerged, including the
   need to better understand 1) seedbank response to burning and herbicide
   treatments, 2) how to optimize grazing animal impacts on medusahead
   given ranch enterprise constraints, 3) costs and benefits of control and
   risk of practice failure, and 4) impacts of adaptive management
   treatments conducted on larger scales and at longer time intervals.
   Addressing these knowledge gaps should help overcome key ecological and
   economic barriers inhibiting implementation of medusahead and other
   invasive plant management programs on rangeland and provide a positive
   step toward conserving the critical ecosystem services these systems

Abstract = {{Extensive livestock grazing is one of the most common and widespread
   forms of land uses in sub Saharan Africa (SSA). Studies assessing the
   effects of extensive livestock grazing on vegetation and soils in SSA
   are inconsistent in the direction and magnitude of study outcomes. We
   applied meta-analysis to identify whether studies so far conducted in
   the rangeland systems of SSA have detected significant rangeland
   degradation as approximated by changes in vegetation attributes
   (reduction in species diversity and richness; decreased biomass and
   ground cover; increased woody species density and canopy cover) and soil
   properties (Decreased soil OC, N and P). We quantified results of the
   included studies using the response ratio, which is the log proportional
   change in the means of a treatment and a control group. Four moderator
   variables (elevation (<1500 and >= 1500 m above sea level); plant life
   form (herbaceous and woody), rainfall amount (<600 mm and >= 600 mm),
   rainfall modality (mono and bimodal), and soil texture (Loam, sandy,
   sandy loam)) appeared to affect the response of species diversity and
   richness patterns to different grazing regimes, i.e., communal grazing
   systems, exclosures, livestock ranches and game reserves. Species
   diversity and richness values were generally lower in the communal
   grazing systems compared to the other grazing regimes. Only three
   moderator variables (rainfall amount and modality, and soil texture)
   affected the herbaceous basal cover response. Differences in soil OC
   were highest between communal and exclosure areas, visible at high
   elevations and under high rainfall. Soil N was influenced by rainfall
   modality and soil texture. We conclude that the effects of grazing
   regimes onto the environment cannot be generalized but are specific
   across vegetation and soil variables and differ considerably with
   rainfall and elevation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reproduction is an important life history trait that strongly affects
   dynamics of plant populations. Although it has been well documented that
   elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere greatly enhances biomass
   production in plants, the overall effect of elevated CO2 on reproductive
   allocation (RA), i.e., the proportion of biomass allocated to
   reproductive structures, is little understood. We combined meta-analysis
   with graphical vector analysis to examine the overall effect of elevated
   CO2 on RA and how other environmental factors, such as low nutrients,
   drought and elevated atmospheric ozone (O-3), interacted with elevated
   CO2 in affecting RA in herbaceous plants. Averaged across all species of
   different functional groups and environmental conditions, elevated CO2
   had little effect on RA (-0.9 \%). RA in plants of different
   reproductive strategies and functional groups, however, differed in
   response to elevated CO2. For example, RA in iteroparous wild species
   decreased by 8 \%, while RA in iteroparous crops increased significantly
   (+14 \%) at elevated CO2. RA was unaffected by CO2 in plants grown with
   no stress or in low-nutrient soils. RA decreased at elevated CO2 and
   elevated O-3, but increased in response to elevated CO2 in
   drought-stressed plants, suggesting that elevated CO2 could ameliorate
   the adverse effect of drought on crop production to some extent. Our
   results demonstrate that elevated CO2 and other global environmental
   changes have the potential to greatly alter plant community composition

Abstract = {{Landscape transformation due to agriculture affects more than 40\% of
   the planet's land area and is the most important driver of losses of
   biodiversity and ecosystem services (ES) worldwide. Ecological
   restoration may significantly reduce these losses, but its effectiveness
   has not been systematically assessed in agroecosystems at the global
   level. We quantitatively meta-analyzed the results of 54 studies of how
   restoration actions reflecting the two contrasting strategies of land
   sparing and land sharing affect levels of biodiversity and ES in a wide
   variety of agroecosystems in 20 countries. Restoration increased overall
   biodiversity of all organism types by an average of 68\%. It also
   increased the supply of many ES, in particular the levels of supporting
   ES by an average of 42\% and levels of regulating ES by an average of
   120\% relative to levels in the pre-restoration agroecosystem. In fact,
   restored agroecosystems showed levels of biodiversity and supporting and
   regulating ES similar to those of reference ecosystems. Recovery levels
   did not correlate with the time since the last restoration action.
   Comparison of land sparing and land sharing as restoration strategies
   showed that while both were associated with similar biodiversity
   recovery, land sparing led to higher median ES response ratios. Passive
   and active restoration actions did not differ significantly in the
   levels of biodiversity or ES recovery. Biodiversity recovery positively
   correlated with ES recovery. We conclude that ecological restoration of
   agroecosystems is generally effective and can be recommended as a way to
   enhance biodiversity and supply of supporting and regulating ES in
   agricultural landscapes. Whether a land sharing or land sparing strategy
   is preferable remains an open question, and might be case dependent.

Abstract = {{The ranges of wolves (Canis lupus) and bears (Ursus arctos) across
   Europe have expanded recently, and it is important to assess public
   attitudes toward this expansion because responses toward these species
   vary widely. General attitudes toward an object are good predictors of
   broad behavioral patterns; thus, attitudes toward wolves and bears can
   be used as indicators to assess the social foundation for future
   conservation efforts. However, most attitude surveys toward bears and
   wolves are limited in scope, both temporally and spatially, and provide
   only a snapshot of attitudes. To extend the results of individual
   surveys over a much larger temporal and geographical range so as to
   identify transnational patterns and changes in attitudes toward bears
   and wolves over time, we conducted a meta-analysis. Our analysis
   included 105 quantitative surveys conducted in 24 countries from 1976 to
   2012. Across Europe, people's attitudes were more positive toward bears
   than wolves. Attitudes toward bears became more positive over time, but
   attitudes toward wolves seemed to become less favorable the longer
   people coexisted with them. Younger and more educated people had more
   positive attitudes toward wolves and bears than people who had
   experienced damage from these species, and farmers and hunters had less
   positive attitudes toward wolves than the general public. For bears
   attitudes among social groups did not differ. To inform conservation of
   large carnivores, we recommend that standardized longitudinal surveys be
   established to monitor changes in attitudes over time relative to
   carnivore population development. Our results emphasize the need for
   interdisciplinary research in this field and more advanced explanatory
   models capable of capturing individual and societal responses to changes

Abstract = {{Conservation management of wetland-dependent species generally focuses
   on preserving or increasing wetland habitat. However, the quality of the
   landscape matrix (the intervening non-wetland portion of the landscape)
   has been shown to be more important than wetland availability for some
   wetland-dependent species. We used meta-analysis to compare the effects
   of wetland amount (measured as the area of wetland habitat in a
   landscape) and matrix quality (measured as the area of forest cover in
   the same landscape) on the population abundance of wetland-dependent
   vertebrates. We combined data across 63 studies conducted in forested
   ecoregions worldwide and extracted 330 population responses for 155
   species, at the spatial scale that best predicted the effects of wetland
   amount and forest amount for each response. In addition, to ensure that
   our results were not biased by the scale selected, we assessed whether
   the relative effects of wetland and forest amount were scale dependent.
   We found that the amount of wetland in a landscape had a larger effect
   than the amount of forest on the abundance of mammals and birds whereas,
   surprisingly, for amphibians the amount of forest in a landscape was
   more important than the amount of wetland. For reptiles, both wetland
   amount and forest amount showed only weak effects on abundance. These
   results were not scale dependent, i.e., they were consistent across
   spatial scales. Our results suggest that the population distribution of
   wetland-dependent amphibians is more strongly related to landscape
   matrix quality than to wetland availability in a landscape, likely due
   to their requirement for access to terrestrial resources. We conclude
   that conservation policies for wetland biodiversity that focus only on
   wetland habitat will be ineffective in conserving many of these species.
   In addition, population viability analyses based only on wetland amount
   may overestimate the capacity of a landscape to support populations of
   wetland-dependent species.}},

   females. This could happen if, for example, males gained fitness
   benefits from extra-pair mating, while female and male extra-pair mating
   behaviours were genetically correlated. Extra-pair males are also
   expected to be older and larger if this improves their ability to
   convince or coerce females to mate. We investigated whether a female's
   extra-pair mates differed from her cuckolded mate in both genetic and
   phenotypic traits by analysing data from an insular house sparrow
   population. We found that extra-pair males were older than cuckolded
   males, consistent with both models. However, in contrast to the
   expectations from from adaptive models, extra-pair and cuckolded males
   were of similar genetic relatedness, and hence expected compatibility,
   with the female, and had comparable body size and secondary sexual
   traits. We also updated previous meta-analyses examining differences
   between extra-pair and cuckolded males. The meta-analytic results
   matched results from our house sparrow case study. Although we cannot
   completely exclude indirect benefits for females, nonadaptive models may
   better explain female extra-pair matings. These neglected alternative
   models deserve more research attention, and this should improve our
   understanding of the evolution of mating systems.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock manure contributes considerably to global emissions of ammonia
   (NH3) and greenhouse gases (GHG), especially methane (CH4) and nitrous
   oxide (N2O). Various measures have been developed to mitigate these
   emissions, but most of these focus on one specific gas and/or emission
   source. Here, we present a meta-analysis and integrated assessment of
   the effects of mitigation measures on NH3, CH4 and (direct and indirect)
   N2O emissions from the whole manure management chain. We analysed the
   effects of mitigation technologies on NH3, CH4 and N2O emissions from
   individual sources statistically using results of 126 published studies.
   Whole-chain effects on NH3 and GHG emissions were assessed through
   scenario analysis. Significant NH3 reduction efficiencies were observed
   for (i) housing via lowering the dietary crude protein (CP) content
   (24-65\%, compared to the reference situation), for (ii) external slurry
   storages via acidification (83\%) and covers of straw (78\%) or
   artificial films (98\%), for (iii) solid manure storages via compaction
   and covering (61\%, compared to composting), and for (iv) manure
   application through band spreading (55\%, compared to surface
   application), incorporation (70\%) and injection (80\%). Acidification
   decreased CH4 emissions from stored slurry by 87\%. Significant
   increases in N2O emissions were found for straw-covered slurry storages
   (by two orders of magnitude) and manure injection (by 26-199\%). These
   side-effects of straw covers and slurry injection on N2O emission were
   relatively small when considering the total GHG emissions from the
   manure chain. Lowering the CP content of feed and acidifying slurry are
   strategies that consistently reduce NH3 and GHG emissions in the whole
   chain. Other strategies may reduce emissions of a specific gas or
   emissions source, by which there is a risk of unwanted trade-offs in the
   manure management chain. Proper farm-scale combinations of mitigation
   measures are important to minimize impacts of livestock production on
   global emissions of NH3 and GHG.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the shape and strength of mating preferences is a vital
   component of the study of sexual selection and reproductive isolation,
   but the influence of experimental design on these estimates is unclear.
   Mating preferences may be tested using either no-choice or choice
   designs, and these tests may result in different estimates of preference
   strength. However, previous studies testing for this difference have
   given mixed results. To quantify the difference in the strength of
   mating preferences obtained using the 2 designs, we performed a
   meta-analysis of 38 studies on 40 species in which both experimental
   designs were used to test for preferences in a single species/trait/sex
   combination. We found that mating preferences were significantly
   stronger when tested using a choice design compared with a no-choice
   design. We suggest that this difference is due to the increased cost of
   rejecting partners in no-choice tests; if individuals perceive they are
   unlikely to remate in a no-choice situation they will be more likely to
   mate randomly. Importantly the use of choice tests in species in which
   mates are primarily encountered sequentially in the wild may lead to
   mating preferences being significantly overestimated. Furthermore, this
   pattern was seen for female mate choice but not for male mate choice,
   and for intraspecific choice but not for interspecies or interpopulation
   mate discrimination. Our study thus highlights the fact that the
   strength of mating preferences, and thus sexual selection, can vary
   significantly between experimental designs and across different social
   and ecological contexts.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of antibiotic resistance carries a fitness cost, expressed
   in terms of reduced competitive ability in the absence of antibiotics.
   This cost plays a key role in the dynamics of resistance by generating
   selection against resistance when bacteria encounter an antibiotic-free
   environment. Previous work has shown that the cost of resistance is
   highly variable, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood.
   Here, we use a meta-analysis of the published resistance literature to
   determine how the genetic basis of resistance influences its cost. We
   find that on average chromosomal resistance mutations carry a larger
   cost than acquiring resistance via a plasmid. This may explain why
   resistance often evolves by plasmid acquisition. Second, we find that
   the cost of plasmid acquisition increases with the breadth of its
   resistance range. This suggests a potentially important limit on the
   evolution of extensive multidrug resistance via plasmids. We also find
   that epistasis can significantly alter the cost of mutational
   resistance. Overall, our study shows that the cost of antimicrobial
   resistance can be partially explained by its genetic basis. It also
   highlights both the danger associated with plasmidborne resistance and
   the need to understand why resistance plasmids carry a relatively low
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances, such as fire and grazing, are often claimed to facilitate
   plant species richness and plant invasions in particular, although
   empirical evidence is contradictory. We conducted a meta-analysis to
   synthesize the literature on how non-native plant species are affected
   by disturbances. We explored whether the observed impact of disturbance
   on non-native plant communities is related to its type and frequency, to
   habitat type, study approach (observational or experimental), and to the
   temporal and spatial scales of the study. To put the results in a
   broader context, we also conducted a set of parallel analyses on a data
   set involving native plant species. The diversity and abundance of
   non-native plant species were significantly higher at disturbed sites
   than at undisturbed sites, while the diversity and abundance of native
   plant species did not differ between the two types of sites. The effect
   of disturbance on non-native plant species depended on the measure used
   to evaluate the impact (species diversity or abundance) and on
   disturbance type, with grazing and anthropogenic disturbances leading to
   higher diversity and abundance of non-native plant species than other
   disturbance types examined. The impact of disturbance on non-natives was
   also associated with study approach, habitat type and temporal scale,
   but these factors covaried with disturbance type, complicating the
   interpretation of the results. Overall, our results indicate that
   disturbance has a positive impact particularly on non-native plant
   species (at least when they are already present in the community), and
   that the strength of this impact depends primarily on the disturbance
   type.
   Synthesis Empirical evidence of the effect of disturbances on plant
   species richness is contradictory. Here we use a meta-analysis to
   synthesize the published literature on how different types of
   disturbances influence the diversity and abundance of plant species,
   focusing in particular on non-native plants. Our study supports the
   hypothesis that disturbances generally facilitate the diversity and
   abundance of non-native plant species, although the strength of this
   facilitation depends primarily on the disturbance type.}},

Abstract = {{A promising option to sequester carbon in agricultural soils is the
   inclusion of cover crops in cropping systems. The advantage of cover
   crops as compared to other management practices that increase soil
   organic carbon (SOC) is that they neither cause a decline in yields,
   like extensification, nor carbon losses in other systems, like organic
   manure applications may do. However, the effect of cover crop green
   manuring on SOC stocks is widely overlooked. We therefore conducted a
   meta-analysis to derive a carbon response function describing SOC stock
   changes as a function of time. Data from 139 plots at 37 different sites
   were compiled. In total, the cover crop treatments had a significantly
   higher SOC stock than the reference croplands. The time since
   introduction of cover crops in crop rotations was linearly correlated
   with SOC stock change (R-2 = 0.19) with an annual change rate of 0.32
   +/- 0.08 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) in a mean soil depth of 22 cm and during the
   observed period of up to 54 years. Elevation above sea level of the plot
   and sampling depth could be used as explanatory variables to improve the
   model fit. Assuming that the observed linear SOC accumulation would not
   proceed indefinitely, we modeled the average SOC stock change with the
   carbon turnover model RothC. The predicted new steady state was reached
   after 155 years of cover crop cultivation with a total mean SOC stock
   accumulation of 16.7 +/- 1.5 Mg ha(-1) for a soil depth of 22 cm. Thus,
   the C input driven SOC sequestration with the introduction of cover
   crops proved to be highly efficient. We estimated a potential global SOC
   sequestration of 0.12 +/- 0.03 Pg Cyr(-1), which would compensate for
   8\% of the direct annual greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.
   However, altered N2O emissions and albedo due to cover crop cultivation
   have not been taken into account here. Data on those processes, which
   are most likely species-specific, would be needed for reliable
   greenhouse gas budgets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{AimClimate change, especially the wider occurrence of extreme events, is
   likely to increase the intensity and frequency of insect/pathogen
   outbreaks (referred to as biotic disturbance), which may considerably
   affect plant ecophysiological traits and thus the ecosystem carbon (C)
   cycle. Little is known, however, about the ways in which biotic
   disturbance quantitatively affects ecosystem C processes, especially
   those that occur below ground. We reveal the general patterns of
   below-ground C responses to biotic disturbance from field manipulative
   experiments and opportunistic events.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodWe carried out a meta-analysis examining the effects of biotic
   disturbance on 16 variables associated with below-ground C processes,
   based on 64 experimental studies.
   ResultsBiotic disturbance significantly decreased below-ground C pools
   with relatively long residence times (e.g. root biomass and soil organic
   carbon, SOC), but increased labile C pools (e.g. microbial biomass
   carbon, MBC; dissolved organic carbon, DOC), soil respiration (Rs) and
   its components, and microbial population sizes. Compared with the
   neutral or positive effects of other environmental changes on
   below-ground C pools and fluxes, biotic disturbance had a negative
   effect on plant biomass and SOC but a larger positive effect on MBC, DOC
   and Rs.
   Main conclusionsBiotic disturbance can have stronger impacts on
   below-ground C processes than other environmental changes, and the
   sensitive responses of soil labile C pools and C fluxes to biotic
   disturbance decrease long-term below-ground C sequestration. More
   research efforts are, however, needed to reduce the uncertainties in
   quantifying the effects of biotic disturbance and to improve forecasting

Abstract = {{Variation in mitochondrial DNA is often assumed to be neutral and is
   used to construct the genealogical relationships among populations and
   species. However, if extant variation is the result of episodes of
   positive selection, these genealogies may be incorrect, although this
   information itself may provide biologically and evolutionary meaningful
   information. In fact, positive Darwinian selection has been detected in
   the mitochondrial-encoded subunits that comprise complex I from diverse
   taxa with seemingly dissimilar bioenergetic life histories, but the
   functional implications of the selected sites are unknown. Complex I
   produces roughly 40\% of the proton flux that is used to synthesize ATP
   from ADP, and a functional model based on the high-resolution structure
   of complex I described a unique biomechanical apparatus for proton
   translocation. We reported positive selection at sites in this apparatus
   during the evolution of Pacific salmon, and it appeared this was also
   the case in published reports from other taxa, but a comparison among
   studies was difficult because different statistical tests were used to
   detect selection and oftentimes, specific sites were not reported. Here
   we review the literature of positive selection in mitochondrial genomes,
   the statistical tests used to detect selection, and the structural and
   functional models that are currently available to study the
   physiological implications of selection. We then search for signatures
   of positive selection among the coding mitochondrial genomes of 237
   species with a common set of tests and verify that the ND5 subunit of
   complex I is a repeated target of positive Darwinian selection in
   diverse taxa. We propose a novel hypothesis to explain the results based
   on their bioenergetic life histories and provide a guide for laboratory
   and field studies to test this hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{1. Meta-analysis has become a standard way of summarizing empirical
   studies in many fields, including ecology and evolution. In ecology and
   evolution, meta-analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and
   control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means,
   using standardized metrics such as Cohen's / Hedges' d or the response
   ratio.
   2. However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but
   also the variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two
   groups may be informative, especially when a treatment influences the
   variance in addition to or instead of the mean.
   3. In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic lnCVR (the
   natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation,
   CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta-analytically compare
   differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use
   of lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution.
   4. Further, as an alternative approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose
   the combined use of ln s (the log standard deviation) and ln x (the log
   mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed) model. The use of ln s with ln x
   ={''}false{''} overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and it provides
   a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation beyond
   two-group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use of
   ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis.
   5. Our approaches to compare variability could be applied to already
   published meta-analytic data sets that compare two-group means to
   uncover potentially overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally,
   our approaches should be applied to future meta-analyses, especially
   when one suspects a treatment has an effect not only on the mean, but
   also on the variance. Notably, the application of the proposed methods
   extends beyond the fields of ecology and evolution.}},

Pages = {{153-163}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing need for scientific synthesis in ecology and
   evolution. In many cases, meta-analytic techniques can be used to
   complement such synthesis. However, missing data are a serious problem
   for any synthetic efforts and can compromise the integrity of
   meta-analyses in these and other disciplines. Currently, the prevalence
   of missing data in meta-analytic data sets in ecology and the efficacy
   of different remedies for this problem have not been adequately
   quantified. We generated meta-analytic data sets based on literature
   reviews of experimental and observational data and found that missing
   data were prevalent in meta-analytic ecological data sets. We then
   tested the performance of complete case removal (a widely used method
   when data are missing) and multiple imputation (an alternative method
   for data recovery) and assessed model bias, precision and multimodel
   rankings under a variety of simulated conditions using published
   meta-regression data sets. We found that complete case removal led to
   biased and imprecise coefficient estimates and yielded poorly specified
   models. In contrast, multiple imputation provided unbiased parameter
   estimates with only a small loss in precision. The performance of
   multiple imputation, however, was dependent on the type of data missing.
   It performed best when missing values were weighting variables, but
   performance was mixed when missing values were predictor variables.
   Multiple imputation performed poorly when imputing raw data which were
   then used to calculate effect size and the weighting variable. We
   conclude that complete case removal should not be used in
   meta-regression and that multiple imputation has the potential to be an
   indispensable tool for meta-regression in ecology and evolution.
   However, we recommend that users assess the performance of multiple
   imputation by simulating missing data on a subset of their data before
   implementing it to recover actual missing data.}},

Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{Deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics may substantially
   alter soil N-oxide emissions. It is particularly relevant to accurately
   quantify those changes to properly account for them in a REDD+ climate
   change mitigation scheme that provides financial incentives to reduce
   the emissions. With this study we provide updated land use (LU)-based
   emission rates (104 studies, 392 N2O and 111 NO case studies), we
   determine the trend and magnitude of flux changes with land-use change
   (LUC) using a meta-analysis approach (44 studies, 135 N2O and 37 NO
   cases) and evaluate biophysical drivers of N2O and NO emissions and
   emission changes for the tropics.
   The average N2O and NO emissions in intact upland tropical forest
   amounted to 2.0 +/- 0.2 (n = 90) and 1.7 +/- 0.5 (n = 36) kg N ha(-1)
   yr(-1), respectively. In agricultural soils annual N2O emissions were
   exponentially related to N fertilization rates and average water-filled
   pore space (WFPS) whereas in non-agricultural sites a Gaussian response
   to WFPS fit better with the observed NO and N2O emissions. The sum of
   soil N2O and NO fluxes and the ratio of N2O to NO increased
   exponentially and significantly with increasing nitrogen availability
   (expressed as NO3-/{[}NO3- + NH4+]) and WFPS, respectively; following
   the conceptual Hole-In-the-Pipe model. Nitrous and nitric oxide fluxes
   did not increase significantly overall as a result of LUC (Hedges's d of
   0.11 +/- 0.11 and 0.16 +/- 0.19, respectively), however individual LUC
   trajectories or practices did. Nitrous oxide fluxes increased
   significantly after intact upland forest conversion to croplands
   (Hedges's d = 0.78 +/- 0.24) and NO increased significantly following
   the conversion of low forest cover (secondary forest younger than 30
   years, woodlands, shrublands) (Hedges's d of 0.44 +/- 0.13). Forest
   conversion to fertilized systems significantly and highly raised both
   N2O and NO emission rates (Hedges's d of 1.03 +/- 0.23 and 0.52 +/-
   0.09, respectively).
   Changes in nitrogen availability and WFPS were the main factors
   explaining changes in N2O emissions following LUC, therefore it is
   important that experimental designs monitor their spatio-temporal
   variation. Gaps in the literature on N oxide fluxes included
   geographical gaps (Africa, Oceania) and LU gaps (degraded forest,
   wetland (notably peat) forest, oil palm plantation and soy cultivation).}},

Title = {{Community-level impacts of white-tailed deer on understorey plants in
   North American forests: a meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Abstract = {{The impacts of introduced or overabundant large herbivores are a concern
   for the conservation of forest plant communities and the sustainability
   of ecosystem function. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are
   considered ecologically overabundant in much of North America. Previous
   work suggests that impacts of deer overabundance are broadly negative
   and are consequently degrading forests at multiple ecological and
   taxonomic levels. However, no quantitative synthesis currently exists to
   verify the generality or magnitude of these impacts. Here, we report the
   results of a meta-analysis quantifying the effects of deer exclusion on
   the diversity, cover and abundance of woody, herbaceous and whole
   community components of forest understories in North America. In
   addition, we explore the relationships of environmental and experimental
   factors on the direction and magnitude of plant community outcomes
   usingmeta-regression. Using 119 calculated effect sizes sourced from 25
   peer-reviewed articles, we constructed 10 community-specific data sets
   and found strongly positive diversity, cover and abundance responses of
   the woody community to deer exclusion, but no significant effects for
   the herbaceous or whole community components of forest understories.
   Local deer density and time since exclusion were significant moderators
   of both whole community and woody community richness. Local deer density
   also moderated the effects of deer exclusion on whole community cover.
   Plot area, in contrast, showed no relationship to any of the community
   response outcomes. We suggest that the use of inadequate diversity
   indices, non-native species replacement or legacy effects of chronic
   deer overabundance might explain why the herbaceous and whole community
   components of forest understories showed no diversity or cover responses
   to deer exclusion. We also suggest some strategies to increase
   opportunities for future quantitative syntheses of deer impacts on
   forests, including providing better access to existing and future data.
   Ultimately, we show that white-tailed deer have strongly negative
   impacts on forest understorey plant communities in North America, but
   these impacts are not ubiquitous for all components of the plant
   community.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{412-420}},
Abstract = {{Exotic plant species can reduce the abundance and biodiversity of native
   plant species. However, the underlying demographic mechanisms for the
   population declines of native plants through individual fitness
   components are unclear. To assess the impact of exotic plant species on
   the fitness components of native plants (establishment, growth, biomass,
   reproduction, and survival), we used a global meta-analysis of 75
   articles representing 232 data points. We examined how the
   characteristics of native and exotic species, environmental conditions,
   and methodological factors modify the magnitude and direction of impacts
   on native fitness. We found that the impact of exotic plant species on
   native plants varied across fitness components. Exotic plant species
   generally reduced the biomass, reproduction, and survival of native
   plants, while they had no impact on the establishment and growth of
   natives. Most studies included in the data set were conducted in
   temperate grasslands and forests focusing on a few life-forms of exotic
   species, making it difficult to draw more specific conclusions of the
   impacts of exotic plant species on native plants. Overall, our results
   indicate that exotic plants may limit the population growth of
   co-occurring native plant species primarily by reducing the biomass,
   reproduction, and survival of individual plants, most likely through
   resource competition. To enable generalisations to be made, we suggest
   that the impacts of exotic plant species on native plants should be
   assessed based on multiple fitness components, preferably across
   different habitat types. Moreover, we encourage impact studies to be
   carried out beyond temperate regions using a wider range of exotic plant
   species. (C) 2015 Geobotanisches Institut ETH, Stiftung Ruebel.

Pages = {{3567-3577}},
Abstract = {{A meta-analysis of photosynthesis-irradiance measurements was completed
   using data from the Ross Sea, Antarctica, using a total of 417
   independent measurements. P-m(B), the maximum, chlorophyll-specific,
   irradiancesaturated rate of photosynthesis, averaged 1.1 +/- 0.06 mu gC
   (mu g Chl)(-1) h(-1). Light-limited, chlorophyll-specific photosynthetic
   rates (alpha(B)) averaged 0.030 +/- 0.023 mu gC (mu g Chl)(-1) h(-1) (mu
   mol quanta m(-2) s(-1))(-1). Significant variations in P-m(B) and
   alpha(B) were found as a function of season, with spring maximum
   photosynthetic rates being 60\% greater than those in summer. Similarly,
   alpha values were 48\% greater in spring. There was no detectable effect
   of sampling location on the photosynthetic parameters, and temperature
   and macronutrient (NO3) concentrations also did not have an influence.
   However, irradiance and carbon dioxide concentrations, when altered
   under controlled conditions, exerted significant influences on
   photosynthetic parameters. Specifically, reduced irradiance resulted in
   significantly decreased P-m(B) and increased alpha(B) values, and
   increased CO2 concentrations resulted in significantly increased P-m(B)
   and alpha(B) values. Comparison of photosynthetic parameters derived at
   stations where iron concentrations were above and below 0.1nM indicated
   that reduced iron levels were associated with significantly increased
   P-m(B) values, confirming the importance of iron within the
   photosynthetic process. No significant difference was detected between
   stations dominated by diatoms and those dominated by the haptophyte
   Phaeocystis antarctica. The meta-analysis confirms the photosynthetic
   rates predicted from global analyses that are based solely on
   temperature and irradiance availability, but suggests that, for more
   accurate predictions of productivity in polar systems, a more detailed
   model that includes temporal effects of photosynthetic parameters will
   be required.}},

   acidification: a meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1671-1682}},
Abstract = {{Concerning their sensitivity to ocean acidification, coccolithophores, a
   group of calcifying single-celled phyto-plankton, are one of the
   best-studied groups of marine organisms. However, in spite of the large
   number of studies investigating coccolithophore physiological responses
   to ocean acidification, uncertainties still remain due to variable and
   partly contradictory results. In the present study we have used all
   existing data in a meta-analysis to estimate the effect size of future
   pCO(2) changes on the rates of calcification and photosynthesis and the
   ratio of particulate inorganic to organic carbon (PIC / POC) in
   different coccolithophore species. Our results indicate that ocean
   acidification has a negative effect on calcification and the cellular
   PIC / POC ratio in the two most abundant coccolithophore species:
   Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica. In contrast, the more
   heavily calcified species Coccolithus braarudii did not show a distinct
   response when exposed to elevated pCO(2)/reduced pH. Photosynthesis in
   Gephyrocapsa oceanica was positively affected by high CO2, while no
   effect was observed for the other coccolithophore species. There was no
   indication that the method of carbonate chemistry manipulation was
   responsible for the inconsistent results regarding observed responses in
   calcification and the PIC / POC ratio. The perturbation method, however,
   appears to affect photosynthesis, as responses varied significantly
   between total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
   manipulations. These results emphasize that coccolithophore species
   respond differently to ocean acidification, both in terms of
   calcification and photosynthesis. Where negative effects occur, they
   become evident at CO2 levels in the range projected for this century in
   the case of unabated CO2 emissions. As the data sets used in this
   meta-analysis do not account for adaptive responses, ecological fitness
   and ecosystem inter-actions, the question remains as to how these
   physiological responses play out in the natural environment.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a meta-analysis of local hunting practices affecting the

   available on this subject and to assess underlying trends in offtake
   rates. We located.. relevant articles in a detailed literature search;
   the data included taxa reported as hunted, the purpose of hunting and
   the hunting method. The families most reported as hunted were
   Herpestidae and Viverridae (excluding Civettictis civetta), with 32.7
   and 19.2\% of total records, with C. civetta comprising 13.5\% of
   records and Nandina binotata 9.9\%. Hunting for consumption was the most
   commonly reported purpose (61.7\% of all records). Sale for consumption
   was associated with 60.5\% of all consumption records, and sale of any
   kind was reported for 56.6\% of all records. The number of carnivore
   carcasses or parts sold at urban markets rose by 8.2\% from the 1990s to
   the 2000s. The commonest hunting methods were traps (31.0\% of records)
   and guns (16.6\%). For records reporting the use of guns, 89.4\% also
   reported sale of some kind. We conclude that carnivores are hunted
   pervasively across the forested regions of mainland Africa and

   probably increasing. These findings have implications for efforts to
   protect dwindling forest ecosystems and to establish sustainable

Abstract = {{As Arctic regions warm and frozen soils thaw, the large organic carbon
   pool stored in permafrost becomes increasingly vulnerable to
   decomposition or transport. The transfer of newly mobilized carbon to
   the atmosphere and its potential influence upon climate change will
   largely depend on the degradability of carbon delivered to aquatic
   ecosystems. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key regulator of aquatic
   metabolism, yet knowledge of the mechanistic controls on DOC
   biodegradability is currently poor due to a scarcity of long-term data
   sets, limited spatial coverage of available data, and methodological
   diversity. Here, we performed parallel biodegradable DOC (BDOC)
   experiments at six Arctic sites (16 experiments) using a standardized
   incubation protocol to examine the effect of methodological differences
   commonly used in the literature. We also synthesized results from 14
   aquatic and soil leachate BDOC studies from across the circum-arctic
   permafrost region to examine panarctic trends in BDOC.
   An increasing extent of permafrost across the landscape resulted in
   higher DOC losses in both soil and aquatic systems. We hypothesize that
   the unique composition of (yedoma) permafrost-derived DOC combined with
   limited prior microbial processing due to low soil temperature and
   relatively short flow path lengths and transport times, contributed to a
   higher overall terrestrial and freshwater DOC loss. Additionally, we
   found that the fraction of BDOC decreased moving down the fluvial
   network in continuous permafrost regions, i.e. from streams to large
   rivers, suggesting that highly biodegradable DOC is lost in headwater
   streams. We also observed a seasonal (January-December) decrease in BDOC
   in large streams and rivers, but saw no apparent change in smaller
   streams or soil leachates. We attribute this seasonal change to a
   combination of factors including shifts in carbon source, changing DOC
   residence time related to increasing thaw-depth, increasing water
   temperatures later in the summer, as well as decreasing hydrologic
   connectivity between soils and surface water as the thaw season
   progresses. Our results suggest that future climate warming-induced
   shifts of continuous permafrost into discontinuous permafrost regions
   could affect the degradation potential of thaw-released DOC, the amount
   of BDOC, as well as its variability throughout the Arctic summer. We
   lastly recommend a standardized BDOC protocol to facilitate the
   comparison of future work and improve our knowledge of processing and
   transport of DOC in a changing Arctic.}},

Abstract = {{AimBiological invasions are among the main threats to biodiversity. To
   promote a mechanistic understanding of the ecological impacts of
   non-native seaweeds, we assessed how effects on resident organisms vary
   according to their trophic level.
   LocationGlobal.
   MethodsWe performed meta-analytical comparisons of the effects of
   non-native seaweeds on both individual species and communities. We
   compared the results of analyses performed on the whole dataset with
   those obtained from experimental data only and, when possible, between
   rocky and soft bottoms.
   ResultsMeta-analyses of data from 100 papers revealed consistent
   negative effects of non-native seaweeds across variables describing
   resident primary producer communities. In contrast, negative effects of
   seaweeds on consumers emerged only on their biomass and, limited to
   rocky bottoms, diversity. At the species level, negative effects were
   consistent across primary producers' response variables, while only the
   survival of consumers other than herbivores or predators (e.g.
   deposit/suspension feeders or detritivores) decreased due to invasion.
   Excluding mensurative data, negative effects of seaweeds persisted only
   on resident macroalgal communities and consumer species survival, while
   switched to positive on the diversity of rocky-bottom consumers.
   However, negative effects emerged for biomass and, in rocky habitats,
   density of consumers other than herbivores or predators.
   Main conclusionsOur results support the hypothesis that seaweeds'
   effects on resident biodiversity are generally more negative within the
   same trophic level than on higher trophic guilds. Finer trophic grouping
   of resident organisms revealed more complex impacts than previously
   detected. High heterogeneity in the responses of some consumer guilds
   suggests that impacts of non-native seaweeds at higher trophic levels
   may be more invader- and species-specific than competitive effects at
   the same trophic level. Features of invaded habitats may further
   increase variability in seaweeds' impacts. More experimental data on
   consumers' response to invasion are needed to disentangle the effects of
   non-native seaweeds from those of other environmental stressors.}},

Abstract = {{The change in the phenology of plants or animals reflects the response
   of living systems to climate change. Numerous studies have reported a
   consistent earlier spring phenophases in many parts of middle and high
   latitudes reflecting increasing temperatures with the exception of
   China. A systematic analysis of Chinese phenological response could
   complement the assessment of climate change impact for the whole
   Northern Hemisphere. Here, we analyze 1263 phenological time series
   (1960-2011, with 20+ years data) of 112 species extracted from 48
   studies across 145 sites in China. Taxonomic groups include trees,
   shrubs, herbs, birds, amphibians and insects. Results demonstrate that
   90.8\% of the spring/summer phenophases time series show earlier trends
   and 69.0\% of the autumn phenophases records show later trends. For
   spring/summer phenophases, the mean advance across all the taxonomic
   groups was 2.75days decade(-1) ranging between 2.11 and 6.11days
   decade(-1) for insects and amphibians, respectively. Herbs and
   amphibians show significantly stronger advancement than trees, shrubs
   and insect. The response of phenophases of different taxonomic groups in
   autumn is more complex: trees, shrubs, herbs and insects show a delay
   between 1.93 and 4.84days decade(-1), while other groups reveal an
   advancement ranging from 1.10 to 2.11days decade(-1). For woody plants
   (including trees and shrubs), the stronger shifts toward earlier
   spring/summer were detected from the data series starting from more
   recent decades (1980s-2000s). The geographic factors (latitude,
   longitude and altitude) could only explain 9\% and 3\% of the overall
   variance in spring/summer and autumn phenological trends, respectively.
   The rate of change in spring/summer phenophase of woody plants

Abstract = {{QuestionsWildfire is a natural disturbance that shapes vegetation
   characteristics worldwide, while prescribed fire is increasingly used to
   modify vegetation composition and structure. Due to invasion of many
   ecosystems by exotic species, a concern of land managers is whether
   wildfire and prescribed fire alter plant communities in favour of
   exotics. We assessed the global literature describing community-level
   responses of native and exotic species groups to wildfire and prescribed
   fire and characterized the geographic and temporal scope of the data to
   inform research needs.
   LocationPredominantly the United States of America and Australia.
   MethodsWe used meta-analysis to (1) test whether native and exotic
   species composition (richness or diversity) and performance (cover,
   density and biomass) differ in response to wildfire and prescribed fire,
   and (2) assess how the composition and performance of these species
   groups vary with time elapsed since fire and habitat types.
   ResultsMost community-level research on how native and exotic species
   respond to fire has been conducted in the US and Australia, typically
   over short time scales, and with a focus on temperate forest and
   grassland ecosystems. Prescribed fire benefited native composition over
   short time scales (<1yr) but, on average, had no effect on native
   performance, nor on exotic composition or performance. In contrast,
   wildfire consistently enhanced exotic composition and performance over
   all time scales, while having no effect on native species composition
   and significantly reducing native performance. Additionally, responses
   varied by habitat: native species groups responded positively to
   prescribed fire in heathlands and to a lesser extent in temperate
   grasslands, while responding negatively to wildfire in arid shrublands
   and heathlands, and to a more modest degree in tropical savannas. Exotic
   species groups responded positively to wildfire in arid shrublands,
   temperate forests and heathlands.
   ConclusionsThis quantitative assessment of the literature revealed
   strong evidence for a positive response of exotics to wildfire, coupled
   with a striking near-absence of negative responses. The assessment
   additionally suggests that while prescribed fire does benefit native
   composition, on average, it does not appear to greatly facilitate native
   performance; however site-specific variation in how communities
   responded to fire was pronounced, underscoring the importance of local
   assessments in determining mechanistic drivers and management policy.}},
