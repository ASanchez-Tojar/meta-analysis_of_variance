Title = {{Developmental temperature affects phenotypic means and variability: A
   meta-analysis of fish data}},
Journal = {{FISH AND FISHERIES}},
Abstract = {{Fishes are sensitive to their thermal environment and face an uncertain
   future in a warming world. Theoretically, populations in novel
   environments might express greater levels of phenotypic variability to
   increase the chance of surviving-and eventually thriving-in the new
   conditions. Most research on the effect of the early thermal environment
   in fish species focuses on average phenotypic effects rather than
   phenotypic variability, but to understand how fishes will respond to
   rising temperatures we need to consider both the average response of the
   population, as well as the breadth of individual responses. Here we
   present the first meta-analysis on the effects of developmental
   temperature in fishes. Using data from 43 species and over 6,000
   individual fish, we show that a change in developmental temperature
   induces a significant change in phenotypic means and variability, but
   differently depending on whether the temperature is increased or
   decreased. Decreases in temperature (cool environments) showed a
   significant decrease in phenotypic means and no change in phenotypic
   variability. Increases in temperature (warm environments) showed a
   non-significant increase in phenotypic means and a marginally
   significant increase in phenotypic variability. Larger increases in
   temperature saw greater increases in phenotypic variability, but no
   increase in the mean phenotypic response. Together, our results suggest
   that fishes exhibit both directed and stochastic developmental
   plasticity in response to warming temperatures, which could facilitate
   or accelerate adaptation to a changing environment.}},

Title = {{Meta-analytic evidence that sexual selection improves population fitness}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Sexual selection has manifold ecological and evolutionary consequences,
   making its net effect on population fitness difficult to predict. A
   powerful empirical test is to experimentally manipulate sexual selection
   and then determine how population fitness evolves. Here, we synthesise
   459 effect sizes from 65 experimental evolution studies using
   meta-analysis. We find that sexual selection on males tends to elevate
   the mean and reduce the variance for many fitness traits, especially in
   females and in populations evolving under stressful conditions. Sexual
   selection had weaker effects on direct measures of population fitness
   such as extinction rate and proportion of viable offspring, relative to
   traits that are less closely linked to population fitness. Overall, we
   conclude that the beneficial population-level consequences of sexual
   selection typically outweigh the harmful ones and that the effects of
   sexual selection can differ between sexes and environments. We discuss
   the implications of these results for conservation and evolutionary
   biology.}},

Title = {{The role of the environment in the evolution of nest shape in Australian
   passerines}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{Avian nests present great variation in structure but, after excluding
   cavity nesters, probably the most obvious difference is that between
   open and domed nests. Some species lay their eggs in open structures,
   exposed to environmental variables, while other species build domed,
   enclosed nests with a roof, which are suggested to protect eggs and
   nestlings from weather conditions, high radiation levels, and predation.
   To date it is unclear which variables drove the evolution of different
   nest types. In this study, environmental and nest type information was
   extracted for continental Australian passerines, showing that species
   with open and closed nests are distributed in similar climates. However,
   species with open nests have larger ranges and are distributed in a
   wider variety of climatic conditions, suggesting open nests could be an
   evolutionary key innovation. This analysis was complemented with a
   detailed study of the evolution of particular nest traits in the largest
   Australasian avian radiation (Meliphagoidea), confirming that adult body
   size - but not environment - is an important factor in nest
   architecture, and larger species tend to build nests that are shallow
   and supported from underneath. Nest structure is a multidimensional
   trait that has probably evolved to match the phenotype of the nest
   owner, but that could also constrain or facilitate establishment in
   different environments.}},

Title = {{Bird guilds show different responses to tree retention levels: a
   meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Since the introduction of retention forestry in the 1990s, its practice
   has spread in the boreal and temperate regions. Its benefits for
   biodiversity are well recognised, and usually presented in the form of
   aggregated results for each taxonomic group. However, ameliorating
   effects of increased levels of retention on species with different
   ecological requirements is still not well studied. With this
   meta-analysis, we aim at disentangling the response of different bird
   guilds, considering the level of retention applied, as well as other
   confounding factors, such as the forest type or harvested area. We used
   a systematic review protocol and collected 30 studies which compared the
   response of birds to a gradient of retention levels against unharvested
   forests and/or clearcuts. Firstly, we compared the overall response of
   the full bird assemblage to retention, and found no differences in
   abundance and species richness between retention and unharvested forest,
   except for the abundance of some forest specialist species. Secondly,
   assessing the responses of various guilds showed that each bird guild
   can be affected very differently, according to their life history,
   biome, forest type and, most importantly, retention intensity. Results
   allow us to infer minimum retention levels needed to preserve each bird
   guild, admitting that other factors can play an important role in
   shaping the bird assemblage, often in interaction with retention. For
   example, canopy and cavity nesters showed a more positive response to
   lower levels of retention in mixed or broadleaved forests than in
   conifer forests. Our results indicate that minimum retention levels
   ranging between 40 and 60\% of original habitat are needed, in order to
   maintain the same bird assemblage as in the autochthonous unharvested
   forest, with particular regard to the forest specialists. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {{Controlling the number of Rorschach responses (R) as a method to reduce
   variability in the length of records has stimulated controversy among
   researchers for many years. Recently, the Rorschach Performance
   Assessment System (R-PAS; Meyer, Viglione, Mihura, Erard, \& Erdberg,
   2011) introduced an R-Optimized method to reduce variability in R. Using
   4 published and 2 previously unpublished studies (N = 713), we examine
   the extent to which 51 Comprehensive System-based scores on the R-PAS
   profile pages are affected as a result of receiving Comprehensive System
   (CS; Exner, 2003) administration versus a version of R-Optimized
   administration. As hypothesized, R-the intended target of R-Optimized
   administration-showed reliable weighted average differences across each
   method of administration. As expected, its mean modestly increased and
   its standard deviation notably decreased. Also as hypothesized, the next
   largest effects were decreases in the variability (SD) of 2 variables
   directly related to R, R8910\% and Complexity. No other reliable
   differences were observed. Therefore, because R-Optimized administration
   does not notably modify the existing CS-based normative values for other
   profiled R-PAS variables, the data do not support concerns that
   R-Optimized administration notably modifies the Rorschach task or that
   existing CS research data would not generalize to R-PAS. However,
   because R-Optimized administration reduces variability in R, it allows a
   single set of norms to apply readily to more people.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Premise of the StudyPolyploidy, or whole genome duplication (WGD), is
   common in plants despite theory suggesting that polyploid establishment
   is challenging and polyploids should be evolutionarily transitory. There
   is renewed interest in understanding the mechanisms that could
   facilitate polyploid establishment and explain their pervasiveness in
   nature. In particular, premating isolation from their diploid
   progenitors is suggested to be a crucial factor. To evaluate how changes
   in assortative mating occur, we need to understand the phenotypic
   effects of WGD on reproductive traits.
   MethodsWe used literature surveys and a meta-analysis to assess how WGD
   affects floral morphology, flowering phenology, and reproductive output
   in plants. We focused specifically on comparisons of newly generated
   polyploids (neopolyploids) and their parents to mitigate potential
   confounding effects of adaptation and drift that may be present in
   ancient polyploids.
   Key ResultsThe results indicated that across a broad representation of
   angiosperms, floral morphology traits increased in size, reproductive
   output decreased, and flowering phenology was unaffected by WGD.
   Additionally, we found that increased trait variation after WGD was
   uncommon for the phenotypic traits examined.
   ConclusionsOur results suggest that the phenotypic effects on traits
   important to premating isolation of neopolyploids are small, in general.
   Changes in flowering phenology, reproductive output, and phenotypic
   variation resulting from WGD may be less critical in facilitating
   premating isolation and neopolyploid establishment. However, floral
   traits for which size is an important component of function (e.g.,
   pollen transfer) could be strongly influenced by WGD.}},

Abstract = {{Despite hundreds of structural MRI studies documenting smaller brain
   volumes on average in schizophrenia compared to controls, little
   attention has been paid to group differences in the variability of brain
   volumes. Examination of variability may help interpret mean group
   differences in brain volumes and aid in better understanding the
   heterogeneity of schizophrenia. Variability in 246 MRI studies was
   meta-analyzed for 13 structures that have shown medium to large mean
   effect sizes (Cohen's d >= 0.4): intracranial volume, total brain
   volume, lateral ventricles, third ventricle, total gray matter, frontal
   gray matter, prefrontal gray matter, temporal gray matter, superior
   temporal gyrus gray matter, planum temporale, hippocampus, fusiform
   gyrus, insula; and a control structure, caudate nucleus. No significant
   differences in variability in cortical/subcortical volumes were detected
   in schizophrenia relative to controls. In contrast, increased
   variability was found in schizophrenia compared to controls for
   intracranial and especially lateral and third ventricle volumes. These
   findings highlight the need for more attention to ventricles and

Abstract = {{Aims Plant responses to disturbances and environmental variation can
   manifest in communities as compositional nestedness (i.e., one community
   is a subset of another) and/or turnover (two communities represent
   different compositional gradient spaces). Yet, different sampling
   designs can artificially give an illusion of such compositional
   differences among two datasets, making it problematic to harmonize them
   in multi-species analysis. We test the prediction that sampling
   differences which increase beta-diversity components (nestedness and
   turnover) among two vegetation datasets will decrease their
   exchangeability. Location Boreal forests of Tanana River region,
   interior Alaska, USA. Methods We develop novel methods for comparing
   compositional variation among two datasets in nonmetric multidimensional
   scaling (NMDS) ordination. Resampled NMDS establishes internal sampling
   variability for each dataset independently, and reciprocal NMDS
   determines external exchangeability when the two are mutually exchanged.
   We first compare simulated data with specified beta-diversity
   differences, then evaluate two forest inventories based on local vs
   regional sampling designs in Alaska's boreal forests. Results As
   simulated species turnover and nestedness increased, internal sampling
   variability remained essentially constant, but external exchangeability
   progressively declined. Species turnover (not nestedness) had the larger
   negative effect on exchangeability. Among the boreal forest inventories,
   internal sampling variability was relatively similar, and
   exchangeability was weakly moderate, but the regional inventory
   exhibited much better fit to broad-scale environment. Species turnover
   (not nestedness) contributed the majority of beta-diversity differences
   among the two forest inventories, suggesting that strong environmental
   gradients were unequally represented. Conclusions Species turnover
   alters multivariate outcomes more drastically than species nestedness.
   Therefore, combining two vegetation datasets may be inadvisable when
   turnover prevails. Instead, a multi-scale perspective, with separate but
   complementary forest inventory analyses, can portray local and regional
   variation at appropriate scales. Our method is tractable for assessing
   exchangeability of potentially inconsistent sampling designs, like those
   that are common in synthesis studies and long-term ecological
   monitoring.}},

Title = {{Nutritional quality modulates trait variability}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Trait based functional and community ecology is en vogue.
   Most studies, however, ignore phenotypical diversity by characterizing
   entire species considering only trait means rather than their
   variability. Phenotypical variability may arise from genotypical
   differences or from ecological factors (e.g., nutritionally imbalanced
   diet), and these causes can usually not be separated in natural
   populations. We used a single genotype from a parthenogenetic model
   system (the oribatid mite Archegozetes longisetosus Aoki) to exclude
   genotypical differences. We investigated patterns of dietary (10
   different food treatments) induced trait variation by measuring the
   response of nine different traits (relating to life history, morphology
   or exocrine gland chemistry).
   Results: Nutritional quality (approximated by carbon-to-nitrogen ratios)
   influenced all trait means and their variation. Some traits were more
   prone to variation than others. Furthermore, the ``threshold elemental
   ratio{''}- rule of element stoichiometry applied to phenotypic trait
   variation. Imbalanced food (i.e. food not able to fully meet the
   nutritional demands of an animal) led to lower trait mean values, but
   also to a higher variation of traits.
   Conclusion: Imbalanced food led not only to lower trait value averages,
   but also to higher trait variability. There was a negative relationship
   between both parameters, indicating a direct link of both, average trait
   levels and trait variation to nutritional quality. Hence, variation of
   trait means may be a predictor for general food quality, and further
   indicate trade-offs in specific traits an animal must deal with while
   feeding on imbalanced diets.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{897-916}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Conflicting empirical and theoretical accounts suggest that dyslexia is
   associated with either average, enhanced, or impoverished high-level
   visuospatial processing relative to controls. Such heterogeneous results
   could be due to the presence of wider variability in dyslexic samples,
   which is unlikely to be identified at the single study level, due to
   lack of power. To address this, this study reports a meta-analysis of
   means and variances in high-level visuospatial ability in 909
   non-dyslexic and 956 dyslexic individuals. The findings suggest that
   dyslexia is associated not only with a lower mean performance on
   visuospatial tasks but also with greater variability in performance.
   Through novel meta-analytic techniques, we demonstrate a negative effect
   size for mean differences (-.457), but a positive effect size for SD
   differences (+.118; SD ratio=1.107). In doing so, this is the first
   study to demonstrate impoverished visuospatial processing of the
   majority of individuals with dyslexia in addition to greater variance in
   performance in this group. The findings advocate for further
   consideration of both the presence of, and reasons for, increased
   variance in perception, attention, and memory across neurodevelopmental

   Across China}},
Journal = {{FORESTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Certainty over warming-induced biomass accumulation is essential for
   addressing climate change. However, no previous meta-analysis has
   investigated this accumulation across the whole of China; also unclear
   are the differences between herbaceous and woody species and across
   plant phylogeny, which are critical for corresponding re-vegetation. We
   extracted data from 90 field-based experiments to reveal general
   patterns and driving factors of biomass responses all over China. Based
   on traditional meta-analyses, a warmer temperature significantly
   increased above- (10.8\%) and below-ground (14.2\%) biomass
   accumulation. With increasing warming duration (Warm(D)) and plant clade
   age, both above-ground and below-ground biomass showed significant
   increases. However, for herbaceous versus woody plants, and the whole
   community versus its dominant species, responses were not always
   constant; the combined synergies would affect accumulative response
   patterns. When considering Warm(D) as a weight, decreases in total
   above-ground biomass response magnitude were presented, and the increase
   in below-ground biomass was no longer significant; notably, significant
   positive responses remained in tree species. However, if phylogenetic
   information was included in the calculations, all warming-induced plant
   biomass increases were not significant. Thus, it is still premature to
   speculate whether warming induces biomass increases in China; further
   long-term experiments are needed regarding phylogeny-based responses and
   interspecies relations, especially regarding woody plants and forests.}},

Abstract = {{Fewer women than men pursue careers in science, technology, engineering
   and mathematics (STEM), despite girls outperforming boys at school in
   the relevant subjects. According to the `variability hypothesis', this
   over-representation of males is driven by gender differences in
   variance; greater male variability leads to greater numbers of men who
   exceed the performance threshold. Here, we use recent meta-analytic
   advances to compare gender differences in academic grades from over 1.6
   million students. In line with previous studies we find strong evidence
   for lower variation among girls than boys, and of higher average grades
   for girls. However, the gender differences in both mean and variance of
   grades are smaller in STEM than non-STEM subjects, suggesting that
   greater variability is insufficient to explain male over-representation
   in STEM. Simulations of these differences suggest the top 10\% of a
   class contains equal numbers of girls and boys in STEM, but more girls
   in non-STEM subjects.}},

   agriculture}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 7}},
Abstract = {{One of the primary challenges of our time is to enhance global food
   production and security. Most assessments in agricultural systems focus
   on plant yield. Yet, these analyses neglect temporal yield stability, or
   the variability and reliability of production across years. Here we
   perform a meta-analysis to assess temporal yield stability of three
   major cropping systems: organic agriculture and conservation agriculture
   (no-tillage) vs. conventional agriculture, comparing 193 studies based
   on 2896 comparisons. Organic agriculture has, per unit yield, a
   significantly lower temporal stability (-15\%) compared to conventional
   agriculture. Thus, although organic farming promotes biodiversity and is
   generally more environmentally friendly, future efforts should focus on
   reducing its yield variability. Our analysis further indicates that the
   use of green manure and enhanced fertilisation can reduce the yield
   stability gap between organic and conventional agriculture. The temporal
   stability (-3\%) of no-tillage does not differ significantly from those
   of conventional tillage indicating that a transition to no-tillage does
   not affect yield stability.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The pace-of-life syndrome (POLS) hypothesis predicts that behavior and
   physiology covary with life history. Evidence for such covariation is
   contradictory, possibly because systematic sources of variation (e.g.
   sex) have been neglected. Sexes often experience different selection
   pressures leading to sex-specific allocation between reproduction and
   self-maintenance, facilitating divergence in life-history. Sex-specific
   differences in means and possibly variances may therefore play a key
   role in the POLS framework. We investigate whether sexes differ in means
   and variances along the fast-slow pace-of-life continuum for life
   history and physiological and behavioral traits. In addition, we test
   whether social and environmental characteristics such as breeding
   strategy, mating system, and study environment explain heterogeneity
   between the sexes. Using meta-analytic methods, we found that
   populations with a polygynous mating system or for studies conducted on
   wild populations, males had a faster pace-of-life for developmental
   life-history traits (e.g., growth rate), behavior, and physiology. In
   contrast, adult life-history traits (e.g., lifespan) were shifted
   towards faster pace-of-life in females, deviating from the other trait
   categories. Phenotypic variances were similar between the sexes across
   trait categories and were not affected by mating system or study
   environment. Breeding strategy did not influence sex differences in
   variances or means. We discuss our results in the light of sex-specific
   selection that might drive sex-specific differences in pace-of-life and
   ultimately POLS.}},

Title = {{Spotted Owls and forest fire: a systematic review and meta-analysis of
   the evidence}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Forest and Spotted Owl management documents often state that severe
   wildfire is a cause of recent declines in populations of Spotted Owls
   and that mixed-severity fires (5-70\% of burned area in high severity
   patches with >75\% mortality of dominant vegetation) pose a primary
   threat to Spotted Owl population viability. This systematic review and
   meta-analysis summarize all available scientific literature on the
   effects of wildfire on Spotted Owl demography and ecology from studies
   using empirical data to answer the question: How does fire, especially
   recent mixed-severity fires with representative patches of high-severity
   burn within their home ranges, affect Spotted Owl foraging habitat
   selection, demography, and site occupancy parameters? Fifteen papers
   reported 50 effects from fire that could be differentiated from
   post-fire logging. Meta-analysis of mean standardized effects (I ledge's
   d) found only one parameter was significantly different from zero, a
   significant positive foraging habitat selection for low-severity burned
   forest. Multi-level mixed effects meta-regressions (hierarchical models)
   of I ledge's d against percent of study area burned at high severity and
   time since fire found the following: a negative correlation of occupancy
   with time since fire; a positive effect on recruitment immediately after
   the fire, with the effect diminishing with time since fire; reproduction
   was positively correlated with the percent of high-severity fire in owl
   territories; and positive selection for foraging in low- and
   moderate-severity burned forest, with high-severity burned forest used
   in proportion to its availability, but not avoided. Meta-analysis of
   variation found significantly greater variation in parameters from
   burned sites relative to unburned, with specifically higher variation in
   estimates of occupancy demography, and survival, and lower variation in
   estimates of selection probability for foraging habitat in low-severity
   burned forest. Spotted Owls were usually not significantly affected by
   mixed-severity fire, as 83\% of all studies and 60\% of all effects
   found no significant impact of fire on mean owl parameters. Contrary to
   current perceptions and recovery efforts for the Spotted Owl,
   mixed-severity fire does not appear to be a serious threat to owl
   populations; rather, wildfire has arguably more benefits than costs for
   Spotted Owls.}},

Abstract = {{Our improving knowledge of the animal tree of life consistently

   hypothesis proposes that selection arising from competition for mating

   evidence showing a link between proxies of this sexual selection and
   species richness is equivocal. Here, we collected standardized metrics
   of sexual selection for a broad range of animal taxa, and found that
   taxonomic families characterized by stronger sexual selection on males
   show relatively higher species richness. Thus, our data support the
   hypothesis that sexual selection elevates species richness. This could
   occur either by promoting speciation and /or by protecting species

Abstract = {{Diet and immunity are both highly complex processes through which
   organisms interact with their environment and adapt to variable
   conditions. Parents that are able to transmit information to their
   offspring about prevailing environmental conditions have a selective
   advantage by `priming' the physiology of their offspring. We used a
   meta-analytic approach to test the effect of parental diet on offspring
   immune responses. Using the geometric framework for nutrition (a method
   for analysing diet compositions wherein food nutrient components are
   expressed as axes in a Cartesian coordinate space) to define dietary
   manipulations in terms of their energy and macronutrient compositions,
   we compiled the results of 226 experiments from 38 published papers on
   the intergenerational effects of diet on immunity, across a range of
   study species and immunological responses. We observed intergenerational
   impacts of parental nutrition on a number of offspring immunological
   processes, including expression of pro-inflammatory biomarkers as well
   as decreases in anti-inflammatory markers in response to certain
   parental diets. For example, across our data set as a whole
   (encompassing several types of dietary manipulation), dietary stress in
   parents was seen to significantly increase pro-inflammatory cytokine
   levels measured in offspring (overall d = 0.575). All studies included
   in our analysis were from experiments in which the offspring were raised
   on a normal or control diet, so our findings suggest that a
   nutrition-dependent immune state can be inherited, and that this immune
   state is maintained in the short term, despite offspring returning to an
   `optimal' diet. We demonstrate how the geometric framework for nutrition
   can be used to disentangle the role that different forms of dietary
   manipulation can have on intergenerational immunity. For example,
   offspring B-cell responses were significantly decreased when parents
   were raised on a range of different diets. Similarly, our approach
   allowed us to show that a parental diet elevated in protein (regardless
   of energy composition and relative to a control diet) can increase
   expression of inflammatory markers while decreasing B-cell-associated
   markers. By conducting a systematic review of the literature, we have
   identified important gaps that impair our understanding of the
   intergenerational effects of diet, such as a paucity of experimental
   studies involving increased protein and decreased energy, and a lack of
   studies directed at the whole-organism consequences of these processes,
   such as immune resilience to infection. The results of our analyses
   inform our understanding of the effects of diet on physiological state
   across diverse biological fields, including biomedical sciences,
   maintenance of agricultural breed stock and conservation breeding
   programs, among others.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive timing in many taxa plays a key role in determining
   breeding productivity(1), and is often sensitive to climatic
   conditions(2). Current climate change may alter the timing of breeding
   at different rates across trophic levels, potentially resulting in
   temporal mismatch between the resource requirements of predators and
   their prey(3). This is of particular concern for higher-trophic-level
   organisms, whose longer generation times confer a lower rate of
   evolutionary rescue than primary producers or consumers(4). However, the
   disconnection between studies of ecological change in marine systems
   makes it difficult to detect general changes in the timing of
   reproduction(5). Here, we use a comprehensive meta-analysis of 209
   phenological time series from 145 breeding populations to show that, on
   average, seabird populations worldwide have not adjusted their breeding
   seasons over time (-0.020 days yr(-1)) or in response to sea surface
   temperature (SST) (-0.272 days degrees C-1) between 1952 and 2015.
   However, marked between-year variation in timing observed in resident
   species and some Pelecaniformes and Suliformes (cormorants, gannets and
   boobies) may imply that timing, in some cases, is affected by unmeasured
   environmental conditions. This limited temperature-mediated plasticity
   of reproductive timing in seabirds potentially makes these top predators
   highly vulnerable to future mismatch with lower-trophic-level
   resources(2).}},

Abstract = {{Many fields of scienceincluding behavioral ecologycurrently experience a
   heated debate about the extent to which publication bias against null
   findings results in a misrepresentative scientific literature. Here, we
   show a case of an extreme mismatch between strong positive support for
   an effect in the literature and a failure to detect this effect across
   multiple attempts at replication. For decades, researchers working with
   birds have individually marked their study species with colored leg
   bands. For the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, a model organism in
   behavioral ecology, many studies over the past 35 years have reported
   effects of bands of certain colors on male or female attractiveness and
   further on behavior, physiology, life history, and fitness. Only eight
   of 39 publications presented exclusively null findings. Here, we analyze
   the results of eight experiments in which we quantified the fitness of a
   total of 730 color-banded individuals from four captive populations (two
   domesticated and two recently wild derived). This sample size exceeds
   the combined sample size of all 23 publications that clearly support the
   color-band effect hypothesis. We found that band color explains no
   variance in either male or female fitness. We also found no
   heterogeneity in color-band effects, arguing against both context and
   population specificity. Analysis of unpublished data from three other
   laboratories strengthens the generality of our null finding. Finally, a
   meta-analysis of previously published results is indicative of selective
   reporting and suggests that the effect size approaches zero when sample
   size is large. We argue that our fieldand science in generalwould
   benefit from more effective means to counter confirmation bias and
   publication bias.}},

Journal = {{AUK}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{206-217}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Across many taxa, clinal variation in body size has been observed to
   follow Bergmann's rule, which predicts larger body size in colder
   climates. For more than a century, this pattern has typically been
   ascribed to selection for large body size in cold winter climates. Here,
   in spatially distributed observational data from 30 populations of House
   Sparrow (Passer domesticus) introduced into Australia and New Zealand,
   we show that this relationship appears to be explained by a negative
   relationship with high temperatures during the breeding season. Our
   results suggest that higher temperatures during the breeding season
   could reduce body size through developmental plasticity, which should be
   considered in combination with or as an alternative to selection. Our
   findings would predict that a hotter climate during breeding could drive
   significant changes in morphology among populations (and potentially
   within populations as well, if climate varies temporally across a
   breeding season). This idea, and our support for it, could account for
   much of the variation in body size that drives the well-observed
   patterns first described by Bergmann, and that are still largely
   attributed to selection on adult body size during cold winters.
   Understanding the mechanisms behind any climate-dependent developmental
   plasticity could prove useful for understanding how endotherms may be
   affected by climate change in the future.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{Animals living at high altitudes have evolved distinct phenotypic and
   genotypic adaptations against stressful environments. We studied the
   adaptive patterns of altitudinal stresses on transcriptome turnover in
   subterranean plateau zokors (Myospalax baileyi) in the high-altitude
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Transcriptomes of zokors from three populations
   with distinct altitudes and ecologies (Low: 2846 m, Middle: 3282 m,
   High: 3,714 m) were sequenced and compared. Phylogenetic and principal
   component analyses classified them into three divergent altitudinal
   population clusters. Genetic polymorphisms showed that the population at
   H, approaching the uppermost species boundary, harbors the highest
   genetic polymorphism. Moreover, 1056 highly up-regulated UniGenes were
   identified from M to H. Gene ontologies reveal genes like EPAS1 and COX1
   were overexpressed under hypoxia conditions. EPAS1, EGLN1, and COX1 were
   convergent in high-altitude adaptation against stresses in other
   species. The fixation indices (FST and GST)-based outlier analysis
   identified 191 and 211 genes, highly differentiated among L, M, and H.
   We observed adaptive transcriptome changes in Myospalax baileyi, across
   a few hundred meters, near the uppermost species boundary, regardless of
   their relatively stable underground burrows' microclimate. The highly
   variant genes identified in Myospalax were involved in hypoxia
   tolerance, hypercapnia tolerance, ATP-pathway energetics, and
   temperature changes.}},

Abstract = {{The operational sex ratio (OSR) has long been assumed to be a key
   ecological factor determining the opportunity and direction of sexual
   selection. However, recent theoretical work has challenged this view,
   arguing that a biased OSR does not necessarily result in greater
   monopolisation of mates and therefore stronger sexual selection in the
   mate-limited sex. Hence, the role of the OSR for shaping animal mating
   systems remains a conundrum in sexual selection research. Here we took a
   meta-analytic approach to test whether OSR explains interspecific
   variation in sexual selection metrics across a broad range of animal
   taxa. Our results demonstrate that the OSR predicts the opportunity for
   sexual selection in males and the direction of sexual selection in terms
   of sex differences in both the opportunity for sexual selection and the
   Bateman gradient (i.e. the selection differential of mating success), as
   predicted by classic theory.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{284}},

Abstract = {{Mutation has a fundamental influence over evolutionary processes, but
   how evolutionary processes shape mutation rate remains less clear. In
   asexual unicellular organism, increased mutation rates have been
   observed in stressful environments and the reigning paradigm ascribes
   this increase to selection for evolvability. However, this explanation
   does not apply in sexually reproducing species, where little is known
   about how the environment affects mutation rate. Here we challenged
   experimental lines of seed beetle, evolved at ancestral temperature or
   under simulated climate warming, to repair induced mutations at
   ancestral and stressful temperature. Results show that temperature
   stress causes individuals to pass on a greater mutation load to their
   grand-offspring. This suggests that stress-induced mutation rates, in
   unicellular and multicellular organisms alike, can result from
   compromised germline DNA repair in low condition individuals. Moreover,
   lines adapted to simulated climate warming had evolved increased
   longevity at the cost of reproduction, and this allocation decision
   improved germline repair. These results suggest that mutation rates can
   be modulated by resource allocation trade-offs encompassing life-history
   traits and the germline and have important implications for rates of
   adaptation and extinction as well as our understanding of genetic
   diversity in multicellular organisms.}},

Title = {{Heterogeneity and Homogeneity of Regional Brain Structure in
   Schizophrenia A Meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{JAMA PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1104-1111}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE: Schizophrenia is associated with alterations in mean
   regional brain volumes. However, it is not known whether the clinical
   heterogeneity seen in the disorder is reflected at the neurobiological
   level, for example, in differences in the interindividual variability of
   these brain volumes relative to control individuals.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether patients with first-episode
   schizophrenia exhibit greater variability of regional brain volumes in
   addition to mean volume differences.
   DATA SOURCES: Studies that reported regional brain volumetric measures
   in patients and controls by using magnetic resonance imaging in the
   MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases from inception to October 1,
   2016, were examined.
   STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies that reported regional brain
   volumes in patients with first-episode schizophrenia and healthy
   controls by using magnetic resonance imaging were selected.
   DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Means and variances (SDs) were extracted
   for each measure to calculate effect sizes, which were combined using
   multivariate meta-analysis.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Relative variability of regional brain
   volumetric measurements in patients compared with control groups as
   indexed by the variability ratio (VR) and coefficient of variation ratio
   (CVR). Hedges g was used to quantify mean differences.
   RESULTS: A total of 108 studies that reported measurements from 3901
   patients (1272 {[}32.6\%] female) with first-episode schizophrenia and
   4040 controls (1613 {[}39.9\%] female) were included in the analyses.
   Variability of putamen (VR, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.24; P = .01), temporal
   lobe (VR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.21; P = .004), thalamus (VR, 1.16; 95\%
   CI, 1.07-1.26; P < .001), and third ventricle (VR, 1.43; 95\% CI,
   1.20-1.71; P < 1 x 10(-5)) volume was significantly greater in patients,
   whereas variability of anterior cingulate cortex volume was lower (VR,
   0.89; 95\% CI, 0.81-0.98; P = .02). These findings were robust to choice
   of outcome measure. There was no evidence of altered variability of
   caudate nucleus or frontal lobe volumes. Mean volumes of the lateral (g
   = 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.29-0.51; P <.001) and third ventricles (g = 0.43;
   95\% CI, 0.26-0.59; P < .001) were greater, whereas mean volumes of the
   amygdala (g = -0.46; -0.65 to -0.26; P < .001), anterior cingulate
   cortex (g = -0.26; 95\% CI, -0.43 to -0.10; P = .005), frontal lobe (g =
   -0.31; 95\% CI, -0.44 to -0.19; P = .001), hippocampus (g = -0.66; 95\%
   CI, -0.84 to -0.47; P <.001), temporal lobe (g = -0.22; 95\% CI, -0.36
   to -0.09; P = .001), and thalamus (g = -0.36; 95\% CI, -0.57 to -0.15; P
   = .001) were lower in patients. There was no evidence of altered mean
   volume of caudate nucleus or putamen.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In addition to altered mean volume of many
   brain structures, schizophrenia is associated with significantly greater
   variability of temporal cortex, thalamus, putamen, and third ventricle
   volumes, consistent with biological heterogeneity in these regions, but
   lower variability of anterior cingulate cortex volume. This finding
   indicates greater homogeneity of anterior cingulate volume and,
   considered with the significantly lower mean volume of this region,
   suggests that this is a core region affected by the disorder.}},

Title = {{Lower average yields but similar yield variability in organic versus
   conventional horticulture. A meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Organic agriculture prohibits the use of almost all synthetic inputs and
   it is expected to have lower impacts on natural resources than
   conventional agriculture. However, previous meta-analyses have shown
   that yields in organic systems are in average 8 to 25\% lower compared
   with conventional systems. Here, we focus on horticulture (fruits and
   vegetables) and we refine our knowledge by characterising the
   distributions of organic and conventional yields both in terms of
   average yield loss and in terms of variability across experiments and
   across years. We built a new dataset including 636 ratios of organic
   versus conventional yields covering 37 horticultural species and 17
   countries and estimated (i) mean yield ratios, (ii) yield ratio
   probability distribution across experiments and (iii) interannual yield
   variances in organic and conventional systems. Our results show that
   yields in organic horticulture are indeed on average 10 to 32\% lower
   than those in conventional horticulture but they exhibit large variation
   across experiments. An analysis of yield ratio probability distribution
   shows that yield loss in organic horticulture has about 10\% chances to
   exceed 50\% compared to conventional systems. The analysis gives also
   around 20\% chances to get higher yields in organic horticulture
   compared to conventional systems. None of the tested covariates (e.g.
   crop type, climate zone) was able to explain a significant part of the
   yield ratio variability. We find no evidence of a larger interannual
   variability (i.e. lower yield stability) in organic versus conventional
   horticulture. Longer-term trials could nonetheless help substantiate
   this result. Our results support also the needs to conduct new
   experiments in countries from the Southern Hemisphere and to collect
   standard data on crop management and environmental characteristics.}},

Title = {{Measuring and interpreting sexual selection metrics: evaluation and

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. Routine assessments of overall sexual selection, including
   comparisons of its direction and intensity between sexes or species,
   rely on summary metrics that capture the essence of sexual selection.
   Nearly all currently employed metrics require population-wide estimates
   of individual mating success and reproductive success. The resulting
   sexual selection metrics, however, can heavily and systematically vary
   with the chosen approaches in terms of sampling, measurement, and
   analysis.
   2. Our review illustrates this variation, using the Bateman gradient, a
   particularly prominent sexual selection metric. It represents the
   selection gradient onmating success and - given the latter's pivotal
   role in defining sexual selection - reflects a trait-independent
   integrative proxy for the maximum strength of sexual selection. Drawing
   from a recent meta-analysis, we evaluate potential biases arising from
   study design, data collection and parameter estimation, and provide
   suggestions to mitigate such biases in future studies.
   3. With respect to study design, we argue that currently almost
   inexistent manipulative studies must complement the dominating
   correlative studies to inform us about causality in sexual selection.
   With respect to data collection, we outline how different measures of
   mating and reproductive success affect the components of sexual (and
   natural) selection that are reflected in standard summary metrics. With
   respect to parameter estimation, we show the potential impact of
   decisions about data inclusion and the chosen quantitative approach on
   inferences of sexual selection and its sex difference.
   4. We expect this meta-analytical review to aid future studies in
   providing less biased and more informative estimates of sexual
   selection.}},

Abstract = {{Low glycaemic index (LGI) diets are often reported to benefit metabolic
   health, but the mechanism(s) responsible are not clear. This review
   aimed to systematically identify studies investigating metabolic effects
   of high glycaemic index (HGI) versus LGI diets in mice and rats. A
   meta-analysis was conducted to calculate an overall effect size, Hedge's
   standardised mean differences (hereafter d), for each trait, with
   moderator variables considered in subsequent meta-regressions. Across 30
   articles, a HGI diet increased five of the seven traits examined: body
   weight (d = 0.55; 95\% confidence interval: 0.31, 0.79), fat mass (d =
   1.08; 0.67, 1.49), fasting circulating insulin levels (d = 0.40; 0.09,
   0.71), and glucose (d = 0.80; 0.35, 1.25) and insulin (d = 1.14; 0.50,
   1.77) area under the curve during a glucose tolerance test. However,
   there was substantial heterogeneity among the effects for all traits and
   the small number of studies enabled only limited investigation of
   possible confounding factors. HGI diets favour body weight gain,
   increased adiposity and detrimentally affect parameters of glucose
   homeostasis in mice and rats, but these effects may not be a direct
   result of GI per se; rather they may be due to variation in other
   dietary constituents, such as dietary fibre, a factor which is known to
   reduce the GI of food and promote health via GI-independent mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive evolutionary responses are determined by the strength of
   selection and amount of genetic variation within traits, however, both
   are known to vary across environmental conditions. As selection is
   generally expected to be strongest under stressful conditions,
   understanding how the expression of genetic variation changes across
   stressful and benign environmental conditions is crucial for predicting
   the rate of adaptive change. Although theory generally predicts
   increased genetic variation under stress, previous syntheses of the
   field have found limited support for this notion. These studies have
   focused on heritability, which is dependent on other environmentally
   sensitive, but nongenetic, sources of variation. Here, we aim to
   complement these studies with a meta-analysis in which we examine
   changes in coefficient of variation (CV) in maternal, genetic, and
   residual variances across stressful and benign conditions. Confirming
   previous analyses, we did not find any clear direction in how
   heritability changes across stressful and benign conditions. However,
   when analyzing CV, we found higher genetic and residual variance under
   highly stressful conditions in life-history traits but not in
   morphological traits. Our findings are of broad significance to
   contemporary evolution suggesting that rapid evolutionary adaptive
   response may be mediated by increased evolutionary potential in stressed
   populations.}},

Title = {{Meta-evaluation of meta-analysis: ten appraisal questions for biologists}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{Meta-analysis is a statistical procedure for analyzing the combined data
   from different studies, and can be a major source of concise up-to-date
   information. The overall conclusions of a meta-analysis, however, depend
   heavily on the quality of the meta-analytic process, and an appropriate
   evaluation of the quality of metaanalysis (meta-evaluation) can be
   challenging. We outline ten questions biologists can ask to critically
   appraise a meta-analysis. These questions could also act as simple and
   accessible guidelines for the authors of meta-analyses. We focus on
   meta-analyses using nonhuman species, which we term `biological'
   metaanalysis. Our ten questions are aimed at enabling a biologist to
   evaluate whether a biological meta-analysis embodies
   `mega-enlightenment', a `mega-mistake', or something in between.}},

Title = {{Dietary restriction increases variability in longevity}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Nutritional environments, particularly those experienced during early
   life, are hypothesized to affect longevity. A recent cross-taxa
   meta-analysis found that, depending upon circumstance, average
   longevitymay be increased or decreased by early-life dietary
   restriction. Unstudied are the effects of diet during development on
   among-individual variance in longevity. Here, we address this issue
   using emerging methods for meta-analysis of variance. We found that, in
   general, standard deviation (s.d.) in longevity is around 8\% higher
   under early-life dietary restriction than a standard diet. The effects
   became especially profound when dietary insults were experienced
   prenatally (s.d. increased by 29\%) and/or extended into adulthood (s.d.
   increased by 36.6\%). Early-life dietary restriction may generate
   variance in longevity as a result of increased variance in resource
   acquisition or allocation, but the mechanisms underlying these largely
   overlooked patterns clearly warrant elucidation.}},

Title = {{Metabolic rates, and not hormone levels, are a likely mediator of
   between-individual differences in behaviour: a meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{685-696}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Consistent individual differences in hormone levels and metabolic rates
   have been proposed to be potential state variables underlying consistent
   individual differences in behaviour (i.e. animal personality). However,
   it remains unclear whether either one alone or both of these potential
   state variables could be an underlying driver of animal personality. We
   address this question using meta-analyses of published data from bird
   species. We hypothesized that state variables that mediate individual
   differences in behaviour would display similar or higher repeatability
   estimates than behavioural traits. To test this hypothesis, we
   quantified repeatability estimates of hormone levels, metabolic rates
   and behavioural traits. We found moderate to high mean repeatability
   estimates for both metabolic rates and behavioural traits, but low
   repeatability estimates for hormone levels. These findings indicate that
   metabolic rates likely represent an important mechanism for generating
   adaptive personality differences in behaviour. We also show that: (i)
   for hormones and behaviour, repeatability decreased with increasing
   interval time between two measurements; (ii) males and females differed
   in repeatability for behavioural traits; (iii) stress-induced hormone
   levels were more repeatable than baseline levels. Future studies are now
   required to determine the direction of the association between metabolic
   rates and behavioural traits. At the same time, these studies should try
   to investigate which of the proposed mechanisms is responsible for the
   relationship between state variable and state-dependent behaviour. In
   addition, we encourage researchers to report the coefficient of
   variation for between-individual variance (CVB) along with repeatability
   estimates because these two indices carry different information. We
   discuss how CVB may better facilitate future comparative studies,
   including meta-analyses.}},

Title = {{The effects of sex hormones on immune function: a meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{551-571}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The effects of sex hormones on immune function have received much
   attention, especially following the proposal of the immunocompetence
   handicap hypothesis. Many studies, both experimental and correlational,
   have been conducted to test the relationship between immune function and
   the sex hormones testosterone in males and oestrogen in females.
   However, the results are mixed. We conducted four cross-species
   meta-analyses to investigate the relationship between sex hormones and
   immune function: (i) the effect of testosterone manipulation on immune
   function in males, (ii) the correlation between circulating testosterone
   level and immune function in males, (iii) the effect of oestrogen
   manipulation on immune function in females, and (iv) the correlation
   between circulating oestrogen level and immune function in females. The
   results from the experimental studies showed that testosterone had a
   medium-sized immunosuppressive effect on immune function. The effect of
   oestrogen, on the other hand, depended on the immune measure used.
   Oestrogen suppressed cell-mediated immune function while reducing
   parasite loads. The overall correlation (meta-analytic relationship)
   between circulating sex hormone level and immune function was not
   statistically significant for either testosterone or oestrogen despite
   the power of meta-analysis. These results suggest that correlational
   studies have limited value for testing the effects of sex hormones on
   immune function. We found little evidence of publication bias in the
   four data sets using indirect tests. There was a weak and positive
   relationship between year of publication and effect size for
   experimental studies of testosterone that became non-significant after
   we controlled for castration and immune measure, suggesting that the
   temporal trend was due to changes in these moderators over time.
   Graphical analyses suggest that the temporal trend was due to an
   increased use of cytokine measures across time. We found substantial
   heterogeneity in effect sizes, except in correlational studies of
   testosterone, even after we accounted for the relevant random and fixed
   factors. In conclusion, our results provide good evidence that
   testosterone suppresses immune function and that the effect of oestrogen
   varies depending on the immune measure used.}},

Volume = {{284}},

Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{Elaborate ornamental traits are often under directional selection for
   greater elaboration, which in theory should deplete underlying genetic
   variation. Despite this, many ornamental traits appear to remain highly
   variable and how this essential variation is maintained is a key
   question in evolutionary biology. One way to address this question is to
   compare differences in intraspecific variability across different types
   of traits to determine whether high levels of variation are associated
   with specific trait characteristics. Here we assess intraspecific
   variation in more than 100 plumage colours across 55 bird species to
   test whether colour variability is linked to their level of elaboration
   (indicated by degree of sexual dichromatism and conspicuousness) or
   their condition dependence (indicated by mechanism of colour
   production). Conspicuous colours had the highest levels of variation and
   conspicuousness was the strongest predictor of variability, with high
   explanatory power. After accounting for this, there were no significant
   effects of sexual dichromatism or mechanisms of colour production.
   Conspicuous colours may entail higher production costs or may be more
   sensitive to disruptions during production. Alternatively, high
   variability could also be related to increased perceptual difficulties
   inherent to discriminating highly elaborate colours. Such psychophysical
   effects may constrain the exaggeration of animal colours.}},

Abstract = {{Self organizing maps for pest profile analysis (SOM PPA) is a
   quantitative filtering tool aimed to assist pest risk analysis. The main
   SOM PPA outputs used by risk analysts are species weights and species
   ranks. We investigated the sensitivity of SOM PPA to changes in input
   data. Variations in SOM PPA species weights and ranks were examined by
   creating datasets of different sizes and running numerous SOM PPA
   analyses. The results showed that species ranks are much less influenced
   by variations in dataset size than species weights. The results showed
   SOM PPA should be suitable for studying small datasets restricted to
   only a few species. Also, the results indicated that minor data
   pre-processing is needed before analyses, which has the dual benefits of
   reducing analysis time and modeller-induced bias. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Theory makes several predictions concerning differences in genetic
   variation between the X chromosome and the autosomes due to male X
   hemizygosity. The X chromosome should: (i) typically show relatively
   less standing genetic variation than the autosomes, (ii) exhibit more
   variation in males compared to females because of dosage compensation,
   and (iii) potentially be enriched with sex-specific genetic variation.
   Here, we address each of these predictions for lifespan and aging in
   Drosophila melanogaster. To achieve unbiased estimates of X and
   autosomal additive genetic variance, we use 80 chromosome substitution
   lines; 40 for the X chromosome and 40 combining the two major autosomes,
   which we assay for sex-specific and cross-sex genetic (co)variation. We
   find significant X and autosomal additive genetic variance for both
   traits in both sexes (with reservation for X-linked variation of aging
   in females), but no conclusive evidence for depletion of X-linked
   variation (measured through females). Males display more X-linked
   variation for lifespan than females, but it is unclear if this is due to
   dosage compensation since also autosomal variation is larger in males.
   Finally, our results suggest that the X chromosome is enriched for
   sex-specific genetic variation in lifespan but results were less
   conclusive for aging overall. Collectively, these results suggest that
   the X chromosome has reduced capacity to respond to sexually concordant
   selection on lifespan from standing genetic variation, while its ability
   to respond to sexually antagonistic selection may be augmented.}},

Abstract = {{Meta-analysis is increasingly used to synthesize major patterns in the
   large literatures within ecology and evolution. Meta-analytic methods
   that do not account for the process of observing data, which we may
   refer to as `informal meta-analyses', may have undesirable properties.
   In some cases, informal meta-analyses may produce results that are
   unbiased, but do not necessarily make the best possible use of available
   data. In other cases, unbiased statistical noise in individual reports
   in the literature can potentially be converted into severe systematic
   biases in informal meta-analyses. I first present a general description
   of how failure to account for noise in individual inferences should be
   expected to lead to biases in some kinds of meta-analysis. In
   particular, informal meta-analyses of quantities that reflect the
   dispersion of parameters in nature, for example, the mean absolute value
   of a quantity, are likely to be generally highly misleading. I then
   re-analyse three previously published informal meta-analyses, where key
   inferences were of aspects of the dispersion of values in nature, for
   example, the mean absolute value of selection gradients. Major
   biological conclusions in each original informal meta-analysis closely
   match those that could arise as artefacts due to statistical noise. I
   present alternative mixed-model-based analyses that are specifically
   tailored to each situation, but where all analyses may be implemented
   with widely available open-source software. In each example
   meta-re-analysis, major conclusions change substantially.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Since Darwin's conception of sexual selection theory, scientists have
   struggled to identify the evolutionary forces underlying the pervasive
   differences between male and female behavior, morphology, and
   physiology. The Darwin-Bateman paradigm predicts that anisogamy imposes
   stronger sexual selection on males, which, in turn, drives the evolution
   of conventional sex roles in terms of female-biased parental care and
   male-biased sexual dimorphism. Although this paradigm forms the
   cornerstone of modern sexual selection theory, it still remains untested
   across the animal tree of life. This lack of evidence has promoted the
   rise of alternative hypotheses arguing that sex differences are entirely
   driven by environmental factors or chance. We demonstrate that, across
   the animal kingdom, sexual selection, as captured by standard Bateman
   metrics, is indeed stronger in males than in females and that it is
   evolutionarily tied to sex biases in parental care and sexual
   dimorphism. Our findings provide the first comprehensive evidence that
   Darwin's concept of conventional sex roles is accurate and refute recent
   criticism of sexual selection theory.}},

   its impact on decision-making: the case of perioperative haemoglobin
   concentration monitoring}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JAN 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: As a part of a larger Health Technology Assessment (HTA),
   the measurement error of a device used to monitor the hemoglobin
   concentration of a patient undergoing surgery, as well as its decision
   consequences, were to be estimated from published data.
   Methods: A Bayesian hierarchical model of measurement error, allowing
   the meta-analytic estimation of both central and dispersion parameters
   (under the assumption of normality of measurement errors) is proposed
   and applied to published data; the resulting potential decision errors
   are deduced from this estimation. The same method is used to assess the
   impact of an initial calibration.
   Results: The posterior distributions are summarized as mean +/- sd
   (credible interval). The fitted model exhibits a modest mean expected
   error (0.24 +/- 0.73 (-1.23 1.59) g/dL) and a large variability (mean
   absolute expected error 1.18 +/- 0.92 (0.05 3.36) g/dL). The initial
   calibration modifies the bias (-0.20 +/- 0.87 (-1.99 1.49) g/dL), but
   the variability remains almost as large (mean absolute expected error
   1.05 +/- 0.87 (0.04 3.21) g/dL). This entails a potential decision error
   ({''}false positive{''} or ``false negative{''}) for about one patient
   out of seven.
   Conclusions: The proposed hierarchical model allows the estimation of
   the variability from published aggregates, and allows the modeling of
   the consequences of this variability in terms of decision errors. For
   the device under assessment, these potential decision errors are
   clinically problematic.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{244-255}},
Abstract = {{Meta-analysis, which drives evidence-based practice, typically focuses
   on the average response of subjects to a treatment. For instance in
   nutritional research the difference in average weight of participants on
   different diets is typically used to draw conclusions about the relative
   efficacy of interventions. As a result of their focus on the mean,
   meta-analyses largely overlook the effects of treatments on intersubject
   variability. Recent tools from the study of biological evolution, where
   inter-individual variability is one of the key ingredients for evolution
   by natural selection, now allow us to study inter-subject variability
   using established meta-analytic models. Here we use meta-analysis to
   study how low carbohydrate (LC) ad libitum diets and calorie restricted
   diets affect variance in mass. We find that LC ad libitum diets may have
   a more variable outcome than diets that prescribe a reduced calorie
   intake. Our results suggest that whilst LC diets are effective in a
   large proportion of the population, for a subset of individuals, calorie
   restricted diets may be more effective. There is evidence that LC ad
   libitum diets rely on appetite suppression to drive weight loss.
   Extending this hypothesis, we suggest that between-individual
   variability in protein appetite may drive the trends that we report. A
   priori identification of an individual's target intake for protein may
   help define the most effective dietary intervention to prescribe for
   weight loss.}},

Abstract = {{The determinants of diet breadth are of interest to nutritionists,
   ecologists, and evolutionary biologists. A recent synthesis addressing
   this issue found conflicting evidence for the relationship between diet
   breadth and mean individual fitness. Specifically, it found that while,
   on average, a mixed diet does increase mean fitness, in some instances,
   a single food provides equal (or higher) fitness than a mixed diet.
   Critical to ecological and evolutionary considerations of diet, however,
   is not only mean fitness but also variance in fitness. We combine
   contemporary meta-analytic methods with models of nutritional geometry
   to evaluate how diet affects between-individual variance in fitness
   within generalist consumers from a range of trophic levels. As predicted
   by nutritional geometry, we found that between-individual variance in
   fitness-related traits is higher on single-food than mixed diets. The
   effect was strong for longevity traits (57\% higher) and reproductive
   traits (37\%) and present but weaker for size-related traits (10\%).
   Further, the effect became stronger as the number of available foods
   increased. The availability of multiple foods likely allows individuals
   with differing nutritional optima to customize intake, each maximizing
   their own fitness. Importantly, these findings may suggest that
   selection on traits correlated with nutritional requirements is weak in
   heterogeneous nutritional environments.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple studies have demonstrated that telomere length predicts
   mortality and that telomeres shorten with age. Although rarely
   acknowledged these associations do not dictate causality. I review
   telomerase knockout and overexpression studies and find little support
   that telomeres cause aging. In addition, the causality hypothesis
   assumes that there is a critical telomere length at which senescence is
   induced. This generates the prediction that variance in telomere length
   decreases with age. In contrast, using meta-analysis of human data, I
   find no such decline. Inferring the causal involvement of telomeres in
   aging from current knowledge is therefore speculative and could hinder
   scientific progress. (C) 2015 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},
