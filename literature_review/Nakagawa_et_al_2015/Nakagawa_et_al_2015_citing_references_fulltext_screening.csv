Most assessments in agricultural systems focus on plant yield. Yet, these analyses neglect temporal yield stability, or the variability and reliability of production across years. Here we perform a meta-analysis to assess temporal yield stability of three major cropping systems: organic agriculture and conservation agriculture (no-tillage) vs. conventional agriculture, comparing 193 studies based on 2896 comparisons. Organic agriculture has, per unit yield, a significantly lower temporal stability (-15\%) compared to conventional agriculture. Thus, although organic farming promotes biodiversity and is generally more environmentally friendly, future efforts should focus on reducing its yield variability. Our analysis further indicates that the use of green manure and enhanced fertilisation can reduce the yield stability gap between organic and conventional agriculture. The temporal stability (-3\%) of no-tillage does not differ significantly from those of conventional tillage indicating that a transition to no-tillage does not affect yield stability."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",no,off_topic,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is renewed interest in understanding the mechanisms that could facilitate polyploid establishment and explain their pervasiveness in nature. In particular, premating isolation from their diploid progenitors is suggested to be a crucial factor. To evaluate how changes in assortative mating occur, we need to understand the phenotypic effects of WGD on reproductive traits. MethodsWe used literature surveys and a meta-analysis to assess how WGD affects floral morphology, flowering phenology, and reproductive output in plants. We focused specifically on comparisons of newly generated polyploids (neopolyploids) and their parents to mitigate potential confounding effects of adaptation and drift that may be present in ancient polyploids. Key ResultsThe results indicated that across a broad representation of angiosperms, floral morphology traits increased in size, reproductive output decreased, and flowering phenology was unaffected by WGD. Additionally, we found that increased trait variation after WGD was uncommon for the phenotypic traits examined. ConclusionsOur results suggest that the phenotypic effects on traits important to premating isolation of neopolyploids are small, in general. Changes in flowering phenology, reproductive output, and phenotypic variation resulting from WGD may be less critical in facilitating premating isolation and neopolyploid establishment. However, floral traits for which size is an important component of function (e.g., pollen transfer) could be strongly influenced by WGD."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,yes,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A recent synthesis addressing this issue found conflicting evidence for the relationship between diet breadth and mean individual fitness. Specifically, it found that while, on average, a mixed diet does increase mean fitness, in some instances, a single food provides equal (or higher) fitness than a mixed diet. Critical to ecological and evolutionary considerations of diet, however, is not only mean fitness but also variance in fitness. We combine contemporary meta-analytic methods with models of nutritional geometry to evaluate how diet affects between-individual variance in fitness within generalist consumers from a range of trophic levels. As predicted by nutritional geometry, we found that between-individual variance in fitness-related traits is higher on single-food than mixed diets. The effect was strong for longevity traits (57\% higher) and reproductive traits (37\%) and present but weaker for size-related traits (10\%). Further, the effect became stronger as the number of available foods increased. The availability of multiple foods likely allows individuals with differing nutritional optima to customize intake, each maximizing their own fitness. Importantly, these findings may suggest that selection on traits correlated with nutritional requirements is weak in heterogeneous nutritional environments."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,yes,NA,yes,99,80,NA,NA,818,818,NA

The X chromosome should: (i) typically show relatively less standing genetic variation than the autosomes, (ii) exhibit more variation in males compared to females because of dosage compensation, and (iii) potentially be enriched with sex-specific genetic variation. Here, we address each of these predictions for lifespan and aging in Drosophila melanogaster. To achieve unbiased estimates of X and autosomal additive genetic variance, we use 80 chromosome substitution lines; 40 for the X chromosome and 40 combining the two major autosomes, which we assay for sex-specific and cross-sex genetic (co)variation. We find significant X and autosomal additive genetic variance for both traits in both sexes (with reservation for X-linked variation of aging in females), but no conclusive evidence for depletion of X-linked variation (measured through females). Males display more X-linked variation for lifespan than females, but it is unclear if this is due to dosage compensation since also autosomal variation is larger in males. Finally, our results suggest that the X chromosome is enriched for sex-specific genetic variation in lifespan but results were less conclusive for aging overall. Collectively, these results suggest that the X chromosome has reduced capacity to respond to sexually concordant selection on lifespan from standing genetic variation, while its ability to respond to sexually antagonistic selection may be augmented."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,no,no meta-analysis of variance performed,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Its benefits for biodiversity are well recognised, and usually presented in the form of aggregated results for each taxonomic group. However, ameliorating effects of increased levels of retention on species with different ecological requirements is still not well studied. With this meta-analysis, we aim at disentangling the response of different bird guilds, considering the level of retention applied, as well as other confounding factors, such as the forest type or harvested area. We used a systematic review protocol and collected 30 studies which compared the response of birds to a gradient of retention levels against unharvested forests and/or clearcuts. Firstly, we compared the overall response of the full bird assemblage to retention, and found no differences in abundance and species richness between retention and unharvested forest, except for the abundance of some forest specialist species. Secondly, assessing the responses of various guilds showed that each bird guild can be affected very differently, according to their life history, biome, forest type and, most importantly, retention intensity. Results allow us to infer minimum retention levels needed to preserve each bird guild, admitting that other factors can play an important role in shaping the bird assemblage, often in interaction with retention. For example, canopy and cavity nesters showed a more positive response to lower levels of retention in mixed or broadleaved forests than in conifer forests. Our results indicate that minimum retention levels ranging between 40 and 60\% of original habitat are needed, in order to maintain the same bird assemblage as in the autochthonous unharvested forest, with particular regard to the forest specialists.

However, no previous meta-analysis has investigated this accumulation across the whole of China; also unclear are the differences between herbaceous and woody species and across plant phylogeny, which are critical for corresponding re-vegetation. We extracted data from 90 field-based experiments to reveal general patterns and driving factors of biomass responses all over China. Based on traditional meta-analyses, a warmer temperature significantly increased above- (10.8\%) and below-ground (14.2\%) biomass accumulation. With increasing warming duration (Warm(D)) and plant clade age, both above-ground and below-ground biomass showed significant increases. However, for herbaceous versus woody plants, and the whole community versus its dominant species, responses were not always constant; the combined synergies would affect accumulative response patterns. When considering Warm(D) as a weight, decreases in total above-ground biomass response magnitude were presented, and the increase in below-ground biomass was no longer significant; notably, significant positive responses remained in tree species. However, if phylogenetic information was included in the calculations, all warming-induced plant biomass increases were not significant. Thus, it is still premature to speculate whether warming induces biomass increases in China; further long-term experiments are needed regarding phylogeny-based responses and interspecies relations, especially regarding woody plants and forests."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,no,no meta-analysis of variance performed,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For more than a century, this pattern has typically been ascribed to selection for large body size in cold winter climates. Here, in spatially distributed observational data from 30 populations of House Sparrow (Passer domesticus) introduced into Australia and New Zealand, we show that this relationship appears to be explained by a negative relationship with high temperatures during the breeding season. Our results suggest that higher temperatures during the breeding season could reduce body size through developmental plasticity, which should be considered in combination with or as an alternative to selection. Our findings would predict that a hotter climate during breeding could drive significant changes in morphology among populations (and potentially within populations as well, if climate varies temporally across a breeding season). This idea, and our support for it, could account for much of the variation in body size that drives the well-observed patterns first described by Bergmann, and that are still largely attributed to selection on adult body size during cold winters.

Yet, different sampling designs can artificially give an illusion of such compositional differences among two datasets, making it problematic to harmonize them in multi-species analysis. We test the prediction that sampling differences which increase beta-diversity components (nestedness and turnover) among two vegetation datasets will decrease their exchangeability. Location Boreal forests of Tanana River region, interior Alaska, USA. Methods We develop novel methods for comparing compositional variation among two datasets in nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination. Resampled NMDS establishes internal sampling variability for each dataset independently, and reciprocal NMDS determines external exchangeability when the two are mutually exchanged. We first compare simulated data with specified beta-diversity differences, then evaluate two forest inventories based on local vs regional sampling designs in Alaska's boreal forests. Results As simulated species turnover and nestedness increased, internal sampling variability remained essentially constant, but external exchangeability progressively declined. Species turnover (not nestedness) had the larger negative effect on exchangeability. Among the boreal forest inventories, internal sampling variability was relatively similar, and exchangeability was weakly moderate, but the regional inventory exhibited much better fit to broad-scale environment. Species turnover (not nestedness) contributed the majority of beta-diversity differences among the two forest inventories, suggesting that strong environmental gradients were unequally represented. Conclusions Species turnover alters multivariate outcomes more drastically than species nestedness. Therefore, combining two vegetation datasets may be inadvisable when turnover prevails. Instead, a multi-scale perspective, with separate but complementary forest inventory analyses, can portray local and regional variation at appropriate scales. Our method is tractable for assessing exchangeability of potentially inconsistent sampling designs, like those that are common in synthesis studies and long-term ecological monitoring."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,no,no meta-analysis of variance performed,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite this, many ornamental traits appear to remain highly variable and how this essential variation is maintained is a key question in evolutionary biology. One way to address this question is to compare differences in intraspecific variability across different types of traits to determine whether high levels of variation are associated with specific trait characteristics. Here we assess intraspecific variation in more than 100 plumage colours across 55 bird species to test whether colour variability is linked to their level of elaboration (indicated by degree of sexual dichromatism and conspicuousness) or their condition dependence (indicated by mechanism of colour production). Conspicuous colours had the highest levels of variation and conspicuousness was the strongest predictor of variability, with high explanatory power. After accounting for this, there were no significant effects of sexual dichromatism or mechanisms of colour production. Conspicuous colours may entail higher production costs or may be more sensitive to disruptions during production. Alternatively, high variability could also be related to increased perceptual difficulties inherent to discriminating highly elaborate colours. Such psychophysical effects may constrain the exaggeration of animal colours."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,no,no meta-analysis of variance performed,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although this paradigm forms the cornerstone of modern sexual selection theory, it still remains untested across the animal tree of life. This lack of evidence has promoted the rise of alternative hypotheses arguing that sex differences are entirely driven by environmental factors or chance. We demonstrate that, across the animal kingdom, sexual selection, as captured by standard Bateman metrics, is indeed stronger in males than in females and that it is evolutionarily tied to sex biases in parental care and sexual dimorphism.

Here we present the first meta-analysis on the effects of developmental temperature in fishes. Using data from 43 species and over 6,000 individual fish, we show that a change in developmental temperature induces a significant change in phenotypic means and variability, but differently depending on whether the temperature is increased or decreased. Decreases in temperature (cool environments) showed a significant decrease in phenotypic means and no change in phenotypic variability. Increases in temperature (warm environments) showed a non-significant increase in phenotypic means and a marginally significant increase in phenotypic variability. Larger increases in temperature saw greater increases in phenotypic variability, but no increase in the mean phenotypic response.

STUDY SELECTION: Case-control studies that reported regional brain volumes in patients with first-episode schizophrenia and healthy controls by using magnetic resonance imaging were selected. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Means and variances (SDs) were extracted for each measure to calculate effect sizes, which were combined using multivariate meta-analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Relative variability of regional brain volumetric measurements in patients compared with control groups as indexed by the variability ratio (VR) and coefficient of variation ratio (CVR). Hedges g was used to quantify mean differences. RESULTS: A total of 108 studies that reported measurements from 3901 patients (1272 {[}32.6\%] female) with first-episode schizophrenia and 4040 controls (1613 {[}39.9\%] female) were included in the analyses. Variability of putamen (VR, 1.13; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.24; P = .01), temporal lobe (VR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.04-1.21; P = .004), thalamus (VR, 1.16; 95\% CI, 1.07-1.26; P < .001), and third ventricle (VR, 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.20-1.71; P < 1 x 10(-5)) volume was significantly greater in patients, whereas variability of anterior cingulate cortex volume was lower (VR, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.81-0.98; P = .02). These findings were robust to choice of outcome measure. There was no evidence of altered variability of caudate nucleus or frontal lobe volumes. Mean volumes of the lateral (g = 0.40; 95\% CI, 0.29-0.51; P <.001) and third ventricles (g = 0.43; 95\% CI, 0.26-0.59; P < .001) were greater, whereas mean volumes of the amygdala (g = -0.46; -0.65 to -0.26; P < .001), anterior cingulate cortex (g = -0.26; 95\% CI, -0.43 to -0.10; P = .005), frontal lobe (g = -0.31; 95\% CI, -0.44 to -0.19; P = .001), hippocampus (g = -0.66; 95\% CI, -0.84 to -0.47; P <.001), temporal lobe (g = -0.22; 95\% CI, -0.36 to -0.09; P = .001), and thalamus (g = -0.36; 95\% CI, -0.57 to -0.15; P = .001) were lower in patients. There was no evidence of altered mean volume of caudate nucleus or putamen. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In addition to altered mean volume of many brain structures, schizophrenia is associated with significantly greater variability of temporal cortex, thalamus, putamen, and third ventricle volumes, consistent with biological heterogeneity in these regions, but lower variability of anterior cingulate cortex volume. This finding indicates greater homogeneity of anterior cingulate volume and, considered with the significantly lower mean volume of this region, suggests that this is a core region affected by the disorder."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Excluded""}",no,off_topic,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lnRR not calculated, and I2 shown for different subsets rather than the overall one"

Parents that are able to transmit information to their offspring about prevailing environmental conditions have a selective advantage by `priming' the physiology of their offspring. We used a meta-analytic approach to test the effect of parental diet on offspring immune responses. Using the geometric framework for nutrition (a method for analysing diet compositions wherein food nutrient components are expressed as axes in a Cartesian coordinate space) to define dietary manipulations in terms of their energy and macronutrient compositions, we compiled the results of 226 experiments from 38 published papers on the intergenerational effects of diet on immunity, across a range of study species and immunological responses. We observed intergenerational impacts of parental nutrition on a number of offspring immunological processes, including expression of pro-inflammatory biomarkers as well as decreases in anti-inflammatory markers in response to certain parental diets. For example, across our data set as a whole (encompassing several types of dietary manipulation), dietary stress in parents was seen to significantly increase pro-inflammatory cytokine levels measured in offspring (overall d = 0.575). All studies included in our analysis were from experiments in which the offspring were raised on a normal or control diet, so our findings suggest that a nutrition-dependent immune state can be inherited, and that this immune state is maintained in the short term, despite offspring returning to an `optimal' diet. We demonstrate how the geometric framework for nutrition can be used to disentangle the role that different forms of dietary manipulation can have on intergenerational immunity. For example, offspring B-cell responses were significantly decreased when parents were raised on a range of different diets. Similarly, our approach allowed us to show that a parental diet elevated in protein (regardless of energy composition and relative to a control diet) can increase expression of inflammatory markers while decreasing B-cell-associated markers. By conducting a systematic review of the literature, we have identified important gaps that impair our understanding of the intergenerational effects of diet, such as a paucity of experimental studies involving increased protein and decreased energy, and a lack of studies directed at the whole-organism consequences of these processes, such as immune resilience to infection. The results of our analyses inform our understanding of the effects of diet on physiological state across diverse biological fields, including biomedical sciences, maintenance of agricultural breed stock and conservation breeding programs, among others."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,no,no meta-analysis of variance performed,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

For decades, researchers working with birds have individually marked their study species with colored leg bands. For the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, a model organism in behavioral ecology, many studies over the past 35 years have reported effects of bands of certain colors on male or female attractiveness and further on behavior, physiology, life history, and fitness. Only eight of 39 publications presented exclusively null findings. Here, we analyze the results of eight experiments in which we quantified the fitness of a total of 730 color-banded individuals from four captive populations (two domesticated and two recently wild derived). This sample size exceeds the combined sample size of all 23 publications that clearly support the color-band effect hypothesis. We found that band color explains no variance in either male or female fitness. We also found no heterogeneity in color-band effects, arguing against both context and population specificity. Analysis of unpublished data from three other laboratories strengthens the generality of our null finding. Finally, a meta-analysis of previously published results is indicative of selective reporting and suggests that the effect size approaches zero when sample size is large. We argue that our fieldand science in generalwould benefit from more effective means to counter confirmation bias and publication bias."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,no,no meta-analysis of variance performed,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, previous meta-analyses have shown that yields in organic systems are in average 8 to 25\% lower compared with conventional systems. Here, we focus on horticulture (fruits and vegetables) and we refine our knowledge by characterising the distributions of organic and conventional yields both in terms of average yield loss and in terms of variability across experiments and across years. We built a new dataset including 636 ratios of organic versus conventional yields covering 37 horticultural species and 17 countries and estimated (i) mean yield ratios, (ii) yield ratio probability distribution across experiments and (iii) interannual yield variances in organic and conventional systems. Our results show that yields in organic horticulture are indeed on average 10 to 32\% lower than those in conventional horticulture but they exhibit large variation across experiments. An analysis of yield ratio probability distribution shows that yield loss in organic horticulture has about 10\% chances to exceed 50\% compared to conventional systems. The analysis gives also around 20\% chances to get higher yields in organic horticulture compared to conventional systems. None of the tested covariates (e.g. crop type, climate zone) was able to explain a significant part of the yield ratio variability. We find no evidence of a larger interannual variability (i.e. lower yield stability) in organic versus conventional horticulture. Longer-term trials could nonetheless help substantiate this result. Our results support also the needs to conduct new experiments in countries from the Southern Hemisphere and to collect standard data on crop management and environmental characteristics."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,yes,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Routine assessments of overall sexual selection, including comparisons of its direction and intensity between sexes or species, rely on summary metrics that capture the essence of sexual selection. Nearly all currently employed metrics require population-wide estimates of individual mating success and reproductive success. The resulting sexual selection metrics, however, can heavily and systematically vary with the chosen approaches in terms of sampling, measurement, and analysis. 2. Our review illustrates this variation, using the Bateman gradient, a particularly prominent sexual selection metric. It represents the selection gradient onmating success and - given the latter's pivotal role in defining sexual selection - reflects a trait-independent integrative proxy for the maximum strength of sexual selection. Drawing from a recent meta-analysis, we evaluate potential biases arising from study design, data collection and parameter estimation, and provide suggestions to mitigate such biases in future studies. 3. With respect to study design, we argue that currently almost inexistent manipulative studies must complement the dominating correlative studies to inform us about causality in sexual selection. With respect to data collection, we outline how different measures of mating and reproductive success affect the components of sexual (and natural) selection that are reflected in standard summary metrics. With respect to parameter estimation, we show the potential impact of decisions about data inclusion and the chosen quantitative approach on inferences of sexual selection and its sex difference. 4.

Meta-analytic methods that do not account for the process of observing data, which we may refer to as `informal meta-analyses', may have undesirable properties. In some cases, informal meta-analyses may produce results that are unbiased, but do not necessarily make the best possible use of available data. In other cases, unbiased statistical noise in individual reports in the literature can potentially be converted into severe systematic biases in informal meta-analyses. I first present a general description of how failure to account for noise in individual inferences should be expected to lead to biases in some kinds of meta-analysis. In particular, informal meta-analyses of quantities that reflect the dispersion of parameters in nature, for example, the mean absolute value of a quantity, are likely to be generally highly misleading. I then re-analyse three previously published informal meta-analyses, where key inferences were of aspects of the dispersion of values in nature, for example, the mean absolute value of selection gradients. Major biological conclusions in each original informal meta-analysis closely match those that could arise as artefacts due to statistical noise. I present alternative mixed-model-based analyses that are specifically tailored to each situation, but where all analyses may be implemented with widely available open-source software.

As a result of their focus on the mean, meta-analyses largely overlook the effects of treatments on intersubject variability. Recent tools from the study of biological evolution, where inter-individual variability is one of the key ingredients for evolution by natural selection, now allow us to study inter-subject variability using established meta-analytic models. Here we use meta-analysis to study how low carbohydrate (LC) ad libitum diets and calorie restricted diets affect variance in mass. We find that LC ad libitum diets may have a more variable outcome than diets that prescribe a reduced calorie intake. Our results suggest that whilst LC diets are effective in a large proportion of the population, for a subset of individuals, calorie restricted diets may be more effective. There is evidence that LC ad libitum diets rely on appetite suppression to drive weight loss. Extending this hypothesis, we suggest that between-individual variability in protein appetite may drive the trends that we report. A priori identification of an individual's target intake for protein may help define the most effective dietary intervention to prescribe for weight loss."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Excluded""}",no,off_topic,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2.97,15.61,9,9,NA

Methods: A Bayesian hierarchical model of measurement error, allowing the meta-analytic estimation of both central and dispersion parameters (under the assumption of normality of measurement errors) is proposed and applied to published data; the resulting potential decision errors are deduced from this estimation. The same method is used to assess the impact of an initial calibration. Results: The posterior distributions are summarized as mean +/- sd (credible interval). The fitted model exhibits a modest mean expected error (0.24 +/- 0.73 (-1.23 1.59) g/dL) and a large variability (mean absolute expected error 1.18 +/- 0.92 (0.05 3.36) g/dL). The initial calibration modifies the bias (-0.20 +/- 0.87 (-1.99 1.49) g/dL), but the variability remains almost as large (mean absolute expected error 1.05 +/- 0.87 (0.04 3.21) g/dL). This entails a potential decision error ({''}false positive{''} or ``false negative{''}) for about one patient out of seven.

We find that sexual selection on males tends to elevate the mean and reduce the variance for many fitness traits, especially in females and in populations evolving under stressful conditions. Sexual selection had weaker effects on direct measures of population fitness such as extinction rate and proportion of viable offspring, relative to traits that are less closely linked to population fitness.

To address this, this study reports a meta-analysis of means and variances in high-level visuospatial ability in 909 non-dyslexic and 956 dyslexic individuals. The findings suggest that dyslexia is associated not only with a lower mean performance on visuospatial tasks but also with greater variability in performance. Through novel meta-analytic techniques, we demonstrate a negative effect size for mean differences (-.457), but a positive effect size for SD differences (+.118; SD ratio=1.107). In doing so, this is the first study to demonstrate impoverished visuospatial processing of the majority of individuals with dyslexia in addition to greater variance in performance in this group.

Across 30 articles, a HGI diet increased five of the seven traits examined: body weight (d = 0.55; 95\% confidence interval: 0.31, 0.79), fat mass (d = 1.08; 0.67, 1.49), fasting circulating insulin levels (d = 0.40; 0.09, 0.71), and glucose (d = 0.80; 0.35, 1.25) and insulin (d = 1.14; 0.50, 1.77) area under the curve during a glucose tolerance test.

HGI diets favour body weight gain, increased adiposity and detrimentally affect parameters of glucose homeostasis in mice and rats, but these effects may not be a direct result of GI per se; rather they may be due to variation in other dietary constituents, such as dietary fibre, a factor which is known to reduce the GI of food and promote health via GI-independent mechanisms."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Excluded""}",no,off_topic,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, it remains unclear whether either one alone or both of these potential state variables could be an underlying driver of animal personality. We address this question using meta-analyses of published data from bird species. We hypothesized that state variables that mediate individual differences in behaviour would display similar or higher repeatability estimates than behavioural traits. To test this hypothesis, we quantified repeatability estimates of hormone levels, metabolic rates and behavioural traits. We found moderate to high mean repeatability estimates for both metabolic rates and behavioural traits, but low repeatability estimates for hormone levels. These findings indicate that metabolic rates likely represent an important mechanism for generating adaptive personality differences in behaviour. We also show that: (i) for hormones and behaviour, repeatability decreased with increasing interval time between two measurements; (ii) males and females differed in repeatability for behavioural traits; (iii) stress-induced hormone levels were more repeatable than baseline levels. Future studies are now required to determine the direction of the association between metabolic rates and behavioural traits. At the same time, these studies should try to investigate which of the proposed mechanisms is responsible for the relationship between state variable and state-dependent behaviour. In addition, we encourage researchers to report the coefficient of variation for between-individual variance (CVB) along with repeatability estimates because these two indices carry different information.

Most studies, however, ignore phenotypical diversity by characterizing entire species considering only trait means rather than their variability. Phenotypical variability may arise from genotypical differences or from ecological factors (e.g., nutritionally imbalanced diet), and these causes can usually not be separated in natural populations. We used a single genotype from a parthenogenetic model system (the oribatid mite Archegozetes longisetosus Aoki) to exclude genotypical differences. We investigated patterns of dietary (10 different food treatments) induced trait variation by measuring the response of nine different traits (relating to life history, morphology or exocrine gland chemistry). Results: Nutritional quality (approximated by carbon-to-nitrogen ratios) influenced all trait means and their variation. Some traits were more prone to variation than others. Furthermore, the ``threshold elemental ratio{''}- rule of element stoichiometry applied to phenotypic trait variation. Imbalanced food (i.e. food not able to fully meet the nutritional demands of an animal) led to lower trait mean values, but also to a higher variation of traits. Conclusion: Imbalanced food led not only to lower trait value averages, but also to higher trait variability. There was a negative relationship between both parameters, indicating a direct link of both, average trait levels and trait variation to nutritional quality. Hence, variation of trait means may be a predictor for general food quality, and further indicate trade-offs in specific traits an animal must deal with while feeding on imbalanced diets."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,no,no meta-analysis of variance performed,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The main SOM PPA outputs used by risk analysts are species weights and species ranks. We investigated the sensitivity of SOM PPA to changes in input data. Variations in SOM PPA species weights and ranks were examined by creating datasets of different sizes and running numerous SOM PPA analyses. The results showed that species ranks are much less influenced by variations in dataset size than species weights. The results showed SOM PPA should be suitable for studying small datasets restricted to only a few species. Also, the results indicated that minor data pre-processing is needed before analyses, which has the dual benefits of reducing analysis time and modeller-induced bias. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence for such covariation is contradictory, possibly because systematic sources of variation (e.g. sex) have been neglected. Sexes often experience different selection pressures leading to sex-specific allocation between reproduction and self-maintenance, facilitating divergence in life-history. Sex-specific differences in means and possibly variances may therefore play a key role in the POLS framework. We investigate whether sexes differ in means and variances along the fast-slow pace-of-life continuum for life history and physiological and behavioral traits. In addition, we test whether social and environmental characteristics such as breeding strategy, mating system, and study environment explain heterogeneity between the sexes. Using meta-analytic methods, we found that populations with a polygynous mating system or for studies conducted on wild populations, males had a faster pace-of-life for developmental life-history traits (e.g., growth rate), behavior, and physiology. In contrast, adult life-history traits (e.g., lifespan) were shifted towards faster pace-of-life in females, deviating from the other trait categories. Phenotypic variances were similar between the sexes across trait categories and were not affected by mating system or study environment. Breeding strategy did not influence sex differences in variances or means. We discuss our results in the light of sex-specific selection that might drive sex-specific differences in pace-of-life and ultimately POLS."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,yes,NA,yes,99.9,98.56,NA,NA,315,315,NA

However, empirical evidence showing a link between proxies of this sexual selection and species richness is equivocal. Here, we collected standardized metrics of sexual selection for a broad range of animal taxa, and found that taxonomic families characterized by stronger sexual selection on males show relatively higher species richness. Thus, our data support the hypothesis that sexual selection elevates species richness.

This systematic review and meta-analysis summarize all available scientific literature on the effects of wildfire on Spotted Owl demography and ecology from studies using empirical data to answer the question: How does fire, especially recent mixed-severity fires with representative patches of high-severity burn within their home ranges, affect Spotted Owl foraging habitat selection, demography, and site occupancy parameters? Fifteen papers reported 50 effects from fire that could be differentiated from post-fire logging. Meta-analysis of mean standardized effects (I ledge's d) found only one parameter was significantly different from zero, a significant positive foraging habitat selection for low-severity burned forest. Multi-level mixed effects meta-regressions (hierarchical models) of I ledge's d against percent of study area burned at high severity and time since fire found the following: a negative correlation of occupancy with time since fire; a positive effect on recruitment immediately after the fire, with the effect diminishing with time since fire; reproduction was positively correlated with the percent of high-severity fire in owl territories; and positive selection for foraging in low- and moderate-severity burned forest, with high-severity burned forest used in proportion to its availability, but not avoided. Meta-analysis of variation found significantly greater variation in parameters from burned sites relative to unburned, with specifically higher variation in estimates of occupancy demography, and survival, and lower variation in estimates of selection probability for foraging habitat in low-severity burned forest. Spotted Owls were usually not significantly affected by mixed-severity fire, as 83\% of all studies and 60\% of all effects found no significant impact of fire on mean owl parameters. Contrary to current perceptions and recovery efforts for the Spotted Owl, mixed-severity fire does not appear to be a serious threat to owl populations; rather, wildfire has arguably more benefits than costs for Spotted Owls."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,yes,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lnRR not calculated, and heterogeneity not estimated for lnCVR"

In asexual unicellular organism, increased mutation rates have been observed in stressful environments and the reigning paradigm ascribes this increase to selection for evolvability. However, this explanation does not apply in sexually reproducing species, where little is known about how the environment affects mutation rate. Here we challenged experimental lines of seed beetle, evolved at ancestral temperature or under simulated climate warming, to repair induced mutations at ancestral and stressful temperature. Results show that temperature stress causes individuals to pass on a greater mutation load to their grand-offspring. This suggests that stress-induced mutation rates, in unicellular and multicellular organisms alike, can result from compromised germline DNA repair in low condition individuals. Moreover, lines adapted to simulated climate warming had evolved increased longevity at the cost of reproduction, and this allocation decision improved germline repair. These results suggest that mutation rates can be modulated by resource allocation trade-offs encompassing life-history traits and the germline and have important implications for rates of adaptation and extinction as well as our understanding of genetic diversity in multicellular organisms."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,no,no meta-analysis of variance performed,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,lnCVR was used but not for a meta-analysis

Recently, the Rorschach Performance Assessment System (R-PAS; Meyer, Viglione, Mihura, Erard, \& Erdberg, 2011) introduced an R-Optimized method to reduce variability in R. Using 4 published and 2 previously unpublished studies (N = 713), we examine the extent to which 51 Comprehensive System-based scores on the R-PAS profile pages are affected as a result of receiving Comprehensive System (CS; Exner, 2003) administration versus a version of R-Optimized administration. As hypothesized, R-the intended target of R-Optimized administration-showed reliable weighted average differences across each method of administration. As expected, its mean modestly increased and its standard deviation notably decreased. Also as hypothesized, the next largest effects were decreases in the variability (SD) of 2 variables directly related to R, R8910\% and Complexity. No other reliable differences were observed. Therefore, because R-Optimized administration does not notably modify the existing CS-based normative values for other profiled R-PAS variables, the data do not support concerns that R-Optimized administration notably modifies the Rorschach task or that existing CS research data would not generalize to R-PAS. However, because R-Optimized administration reduces variability in R, it allows a single set of norms to apply readily to more people."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Excluded""}",no,off_topic,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lnCVR not used, lnsd instead"

Many studies, both experimental and correlational, have been conducted to test the relationship between immune function and the sex hormones testosterone in males and oestrogen in females. However, the results are mixed. We conducted four cross-species meta-analyses to investigate the relationship between sex hormones and immune function: (i) the effect of testosterone manipulation on immune function in males, (ii) the correlation between circulating testosterone level and immune function in males, (iii) the effect of oestrogen manipulation on immune function in females, and (iv) the correlation between circulating oestrogen level and immune function in females. The results from the experimental studies showed that testosterone had a medium-sized immunosuppressive effect on immune function. The effect of oestrogen, on the other hand, depended on the immune measure used. Oestrogen suppressed cell-mediated immune function while reducing parasite loads. The overall correlation (meta-analytic relationship) between circulating sex hormone level and immune function was not statistically significant for either testosterone or oestrogen despite the power of meta-analysis. These results suggest that correlational studies have limited value for testing the effects of sex hormones on immune function. We found little evidence of publication bias in the four data sets using indirect tests. There was a weak and positive relationship between year of publication and effect size for experimental studies of testosterone that became non-significant after we controlled for castration and immune measure, suggesting that the temporal trend was due to changes in these moderators over time. Graphical analyses suggest that the temporal trend was due to an increased use of cytokine measures across time. We found substantial heterogeneity in effect sizes, except in correlational studies of testosterone, even after we accounted for the relevant random and fixed factors. In conclusion, our results provide good evidence that testosterone suppresses immune function and that the effect of oestrogen varies depending on the immune measure used."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,no,no meta-analysis of variance performed,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Some species lay their eggs in open structures, exposed to environmental variables, while other species build domed, enclosed nests with a roof, which are suggested to protect eggs and nestlings from weather conditions, high radiation levels, and predation. To date it is unclear which variables drove the evolution of different nest types. In this study, environmental and nest type information was extracted for continental Australian passerines, showing that species with open and closed nests are distributed in similar climates. However, species with open nests have larger ranges and are distributed in a wider variety of climatic conditions, suggesting open nests could be an evolutionary key innovation. This analysis was complemented with a detailed study of the evolution of particular nest traits in the largest Australasian avian radiation (Meliphagoidea), confirming that adult body size - but not environment - is an important factor in nest architecture, and larger species tend to build nests that are shallow and supported from underneath. Nest structure is a multidimensional trait that has probably evolved to match the phenotype of the nest owner, but that could also constrain or facilitate establishment in different environments."," RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alfredo""=>""Included""}",yes,NA,no,no meta-analysis of variance performed,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
